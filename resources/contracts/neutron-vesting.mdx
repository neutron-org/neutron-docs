## Understanding Vesting Contracts

Neutron uses several types of vesting contracts to manage token release schedules for different groups:

### Investor Vesting

The investor vesting contracts manage token release schedules for private sale participants. These contracts typically:

- Release tokens gradually over a predefined period
- May include a cliff period before any tokens are released
- Provide options for governance participation during the vesting period

### LP Vesting

The LP (Liquidity Provider) vesting contracts manage incentives for liquidity providers who participated in Neutron's initial liquidity bootstrapping. These contracts:

- Release tokens over time to encourage long-term liquidity provision
- Can be integrated with DEX pools to provide ongoing incentives

### LTI Vesting

The LTI (Long-Term Incentive) vesting contracts manage token release for Neutron team members and advisors. These typically have:

- Longer vesting periods to ensure long-term alignment
- Structured release schedules to match project milestones

## Vesting Contract Features

The Neutron vesting contracts include several features:

1. **Scheduled Release**: Tokens are released according to a predefined schedule, usually linear or milestone-based
2. **Governance Rights**: Some vesting contracts allow vested tokens to be used for governance while still locked
3. **Vault Integration**: Vesting contracts can be integrated with vaults for additional functionality
4. **Delegation Rights**: Some contracts allow staking and delegation of vested tokens while they're still locked

## Interacting with Vesting Contracts

To check vesting information for a specific address:

```bash
# Query vesting info
neutrond query wasm contract-state smart neutron17fcdl6crgsp49ja270fp0pdwm354ar5qqv3mda07py58lgqmm2sqasvgz9 \
'{"vesting_info":{"address":"your-neutron-address"}}'

# Check claimable amount
neutrond query wasm contract-state smart neutron17fcdl6crgsp49ja270fp0pdwm354ar5qqv3mda07py58lgqmm2sqasvgz9 \
'{"claimable":{"address":"your-neutron-address"}}'

# Claim vested tokens
neutrond tx wasm execute neutron17fcdl6crgsp49ja270fp0pdwm354ar5qqv3mda07py58lgqmm2sqasvgz9 \
'{"claim":{}}' \
--from your-key --chain-id neutron-1 --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3
```

## Vesting Schedules

Vesting schedules vary by contract and recipient category, but generally follow these patterns:

- **Team and Advisors**: 3-4 year vesting with 12-month cliff
- **Investors**: 18-24 month vesting with various cliff periods
- **Liquidity Providers**: Shorter vesting periods (6-12 months) to encourage initial liquidity
- **Ecosystem Fund**: Controlled by the DAO for strategic allocations

You can view the specific vesting schedule for your allocation by querying the relevant contract with your address.
