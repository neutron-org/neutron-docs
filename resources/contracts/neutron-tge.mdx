## Understanding the TGE Contracts

The Neutron TGE process included several mechanisms:

### Airdrop

The airdrop contract distributed NTRN tokens to eligible addresses using a Merkle proof verification system. Eligible addresses were determined based on their activities in the Cosmos ecosystem.

### Lockdrop

The Lockdrop allowed users to lock ATOM or USDC tokens for a predetermined period to receive NTRN tokens. The longer the tokens were locked, the greater the NTRN allocation received. This contract also managed the process of returning the locked tokens after the lockdrop period ended.

### Auction

The auction contract facilitated a batch auction phase of the TGE, allowing participants to bid on NTRN tokens with ATOM or USDC.

### Credits

The Credits contract managed pre-sale allocations for specific participants.

### Vesting

Various vesting contracts manage the gradual release of NTRN tokens to different participant categories, including liquidity providers, investors, and team members.

## Interacting with the TGE Contracts

Most TGE contracts have completed their primary functions, but you can still query their state:

```bash
# Check if you have an unclaimed airdrop
neutrond query wasm contract-state smart neutron198sxsrjvt2v2lln2ajn82ks76k97mj72mtgl7309jehd0vy8rezs7e6c56 '{"is_claimed":{"address":"your-neutron-address"}}'

# Check vesting contract status
neutrond query wasm contract-state smart neutron1kkwp7pd4ts6gukm3e820kyftz4vv5jqtmal8pwqezrnq2ddycqasr87x9p '{"vesting_status":{}}'
```

## TGE Timeline

The Neutron TGE occurred in phases:

1. **Airdrop**: May 2023
2. **Lockdrop**: May-June 2023
3. **Auction**: June 2023
4. **Mainnet Launch**: July 2023

The vesting contracts continue to release tokens according to their specific schedules, which vary by contract type and participant category.
