This page provides information about the smart contracts that enable cross-chain bridging between Neutron and other networks.

## Mainnet (neutron-1)

| Contract | Address | Code ID |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Lido Satellite (neutron-1) | `neutron1ug740qrkquxzrk2hh29qrlx3sktkfml3je7juusc2te7xmvsscns0n2wry` | 233 |
| GMP Helper (Ethereum) | `0x8A5fcd88B4aC70A1939955fAeA4E12bd0C7B1237` | - |

## Testnet (pion-1)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| Lido Satellite (pion-1) | `neutron1pf7u5tqkc9xc5l2xjqzsufc467ccmjxw68v5hl0k5gaye7zer3tqvrucam` |
| GMP Helper (Sepolia) | `0x5b154522aa5CDDCed12515719E1d4dFf76F2b37b` |

## Lido Satellite Contract

The Lido Satellite contract enables bridging of Lido's staked ETH (stETH) to Neutron. It provides a TokenFactory representation of the wrapped staked ETH (wstETH) which can be used throughout the Neutron ecosystem.

### Supported Tokens

| Network | Symbol | Denom |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Mainnet | wstETH | `factory/neutron1ug740qrkquxzrk2hh29qrlx3sktkfml3je7juusc2te7xmvsscns0n2wry/wstETH` |
| Testnet | wstETH | `factory/neutron1pf7u5tqkc9xc5l2xjqzsufc467ccmjxw68v5hl0k5gaye7zer3tqvrucam/wstETH` |

### How the Bridge Works

1. **Axelar Integration**: The Neutron bridge uses Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP) to facilitate cross-chain communication
2. **Minting and Burning**: When wstETH is bridged to Neutron, the corresponding tokens are locked on Ethereum, and native tokens are minted on Neutron
3. **Token Standards**: TokenFactory standards on Neutron ensure that the bridged tokens behave like native Cosmos assets
4. **Fee Mechanics**: The bridge charges a small fee for transfers to cover operational costs

## Using the Bridge

To interact with the bridge, you can use the [Neutron Bridge UI](https://bridge.neutron.org/) or interact directly with the contracts.

### Example Bridge Queries

```bash
# Query bridge token info
neutrond query wasm contract-state smart neutron1ug740qrkquxzrk2hh29qrlx3sktkfml3je7juusc2te7xmvsscns0n2wry '{"token_info":{}}'

# Check bridge limits
neutrond query wasm contract-state smart neutron1ug740qrkquxzrk2hh29qrlx3sktkfml3je7juusc2te7xmvsscns0n2wry '{"bridge_limits":{}}'
```

## Bridge Security

The bridge security model includes:

1. **Axelar Validators**: The bridge relies on Axelar's validator network for secure message passing
2. **Multi-Signature Controls**: Administrative actions require approval from multiple parties
3. **Rate Limiting**: The bridge includes rate limits to prevent catastrophic failures
4. **Upgradability**: The bridge can be upgraded to patch security vulnerabilities

## Future Bridge Developments

The Neutron team is working on expanding bridge capabilities to include:

1. More assets and token standards
2. Additional source chains beyond Ethereum
3. Improved efficiency and reduced fees
4. Enhanced user interfaces for easier bridging

## Bridge Monitoring
