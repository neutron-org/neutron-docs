Neutron Developer Relations Technical Study Guide
Overview: This comprehensive study guide is organized into seven modules, each aligned with strategic focus areas for Neutron’s post-Mercury environment. It is tailored for a Developer Relations Engineer with Cosmos experience, aiming to deepen understanding of Neutron’s infrastructure and to inform high-quality technical documentation and education. The Mercury upgrade (April 2025) transitioned Neutron from being secured by Cosmos Hub’s Interchain Security (ICS) to a fully sovereign L1, unlocking major performance boosts and new features. Each module below provides a deep technical overview, code examples or references, Mercury-specific changes, developer-friendly analogies, key Q&A, documentation tips, relevant codebase pointers, and comparisons to Cosmos/EVM ts for context.
Module 1: Neutron’s Integrated Infrastructure (Oracle, Cron & Performance)
Technical Overview
Neutron is designed as an “Integrated Application Network” – meaning core financial infrastructure is enshrined at the chain level rather than entirely built in smart contracts. Two standout enshrined modules are the Oracle and Cron modules, which give smart contracts capabilities typically requiring off-chain services. The Oracle Module (code-named “Slinky” in docs) is built into the blockchain, providing native price feeds and arbitrary data via consensus. Validators publish price updates ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)ck, so contracts can trust on-chain prices without relying on external oracles. This lowers latency and prevents manipulation by arbitrageurs delaying price updates. The Cron Module allows scheduling of contract execution at end-of-block, enabling automated tasks (e.g. periodic interest payouts, batch auctions) to run reliably without needing external bots. Together, these integrated services reduce operational complexity and risk for DeFi ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)ical functions like liquidations or yield compounding can be guaranteed by the protocol itself rather than ad-hoc off-chain keepers.
Beyond Oracle and Cron, Neutron’s infrastructure includes an enshrined or ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)ybrid DEX (Duality), and other features that blur the line between “app” and “protocol.” For example, Duality is a high-performance DEX built into Neutron that combines orderbook and AMM advantages【38†L52-L6 ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)s advanced order types and shared liquidity pools for all protocols, so developers can leverage a built-in exchange rather than deploying their own. In Neutron, smart contracts have access to functionality beyond the VM – such as block data, mempool priorities, interchain queries, etc. – giving them “the power of an appchain”. This integrated approach yield ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)posability** (multiple actions across these module ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)action) and enhanced reliability (fewer external dependenc ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)n’s integrated infrastructure is underpinned by Cosmos SDK modules in the chain’s codebase. For instance, the x/cron module (in the Neutron GitHub) defines how gov ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)thorized entities can register a CosmWasm contract call to execute every N blocks. The x/oracle module (not explicitly named here, but part of Neutron’s core) likely handles validator price vote collection and making price data queryable to contracts. These modules work in tandem with CosmWasm (Neutron’s smart contract engine) to extend what on-chain logic can do. Inter-module hooks ensure, for example, that the Oracle updates before any DeFi contract execution, and Cron triggers at the very end of a block, so scheduled tasks run after all user transactions (preventing front-running of those tasks). In short, Neutron’s infrastructure is highly optimized for DeFi needs: rather than a generic Layer-1, it’s an “app-specific blockchain” whose built-in services any contract can leverage.
Mercury Enhancements
The Mercury upgrade dramatically improved this infrastructure’s performance and autonomy. By exiting Cosmos Hub’s ICS and becoming sovereign, Neutron could overhaul consensus parameters and remove ICS overhead. Throughput was raised 11× – the gas per block jumped from 30 million to 330 million, unlocking much heavier or more complex contract executions. This makes Neutron one of the highest-capacity chains (for comparison, 330M gas per block is about 11× Cosmos Hub’s previous limit) and enables advanced use cases like on-chain orderbook matching and perpetual futures clusters that need lots of computation. Block latency is on track to shrink ~18×, from ~1.8 seconds to ~0.1 seconds per block. Mercury introduced consensus and block-production optimizations to begin reducing block time, with a goal of ~100ms finality by end of 2025. Faster blocks and higher gas throughput together elevate Neutron’s execution speed to industry-leading levels (Neutron: From Interchain Security to Full Sovereignty - StakeCito) (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)block time improvements after Mercury: Neutron plans to reduce block latency from ~1.8s today to ~0.1s by end of 2025, enabling lig (Overview | Neutron Docs)t user experiences. Shorter block times mean transactions confirm almost instantly, a crucial advantage for trading and DeFi interactions. Such performance gains have been made possible by refining consensus (e.g., pipelining block processing) now that Neutron controls its own validator (Neutron · GitHub)y also activated the enshrined Oracle’s high-frequency mode: price feeds are now updated every block with high reliability. Validators are expected to include price votes in each block – a “high frequen (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)hich significantly reduces price latency for on-chain use. This was complemented by hardware and consensus stability improvements to ensure these frequent updates don’t hinder performance. The Cron module was live pre-Mercury and continues to be a key piece, but with higher throughput it can handle more scheduled tasks per block if needed. Another improvement is removal of the ICS “CCV” module (cross-chain validation logic), which simplified Neutron’s codebase and dependencies, allowing faster upgrades going forward【15†L (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)tron’s validator set is now independent, and the chain can push updates on its own schedule without coordinating through the Cosmos Hub (previous ICS governance cycles could slow things down).
A notable economic change in Mercury is the new validator economic model. Under ICS, Neutron’s security was tied to ATOM staked on the Hub, but now Neutron must incentivize its own NTRN stakers. The upgrade introduced a target staking reward of ~3% APR for NTRN – a relatively low inflation designed to protect token value while still rew (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)ors. To bootstrap validator operations, the community set a base compensation of $3,000/month per validator from the treasury. This ensures critical validators have sustainable revenue, given the (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)taking APR. Mercury also disabled slashing (temporarily) and instead enforces performance via uptime and oracle feed thresholds. For example, validators must sign 95–99.5% of blocks and provide 95–98% of price updates to qualify for full rewards. This is a unique approach: rather than risk disruptions during the transition, Neutron opted to trust a curated set of ~20 genesis validators and focus on liveness; slashing will likely be re-enabled as the set grows. Overall, Mercury’s changes ensure Neutron’s integrated modules run at top speed and reliability, backed by a lean, self-sufficient validator set and economic incentives aligned to network performance.
Developer Analogy
Think of Neutron’s integrated infra like a “Swiss Army knife blockchain” for DeFi. On a standard chain (Cosmos or Ethereum), if you need price data, you’d call an external oracle service (like asking a friend for the market price); if you need scheduled tasks, you’d set up off-chain bots (like setting an alarm clock that may or may not ring). On Neutron, the chain itself provides these tools – as if the blockchain comes with built-in price oracles and alarm clocks for your contracts. This is analogous to cloud p (Neutron: From Interchain Security to Full Sovereignty - StakeCito) (Overview | Neutron Docs)aged databases and cron jobs along with compute: Neutron offers managed oracle feeds and automation alongside smart contracts. The benefit is less work and risk for developers – you don’t need to rely on external keepers (which can crash or be late) or third-party oracles (which might be slow or manipulated). As a developer, you can trust that each block, the Oracle module has updated prices (much like how each tick of a stock exchange updates the last price), and that end-of-block, any registered Cron tasks will run on time (like guaranteed cron jobs on a server). In short, Neutron’s chain is both the platform and the service provider – akin to h (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog) AWS Lambda (smart contracts) and an AWS CloudWatch Events (Cron) plus price feeds (Oracle) under one roof.
Another analogy: Exiting ICS is like Neutron “graduating and getting the keys to its own car.” Initially, Neutron carpooled with Cosmos Hub – it had to follow the Hub’s route and schedule (Hub validators, slower upgrades). After Mercury, Neutron drives itself: it can accelerate (shorter blocks) and take detours (upgrade faster, add features) without asking Cosmos Hub’s permission. The integrated engine has been souped-up – more horsepower in each block (11× gas) and faster laps (0.1s blocks). This autonomy does mean Neutron must pay for its own gas and maintenance (its own validators and rewards), but it’s free to optimize for the fastest, smoothest DeFi ride possible.
Key Developer Q&A
* Q: Why build an in-protocol Oracle instead of using Chainlink or Band?
 A: An in-protocol oracle means price data is updated as part of the chain’s consensus, offering lower latency and higher security for on-chain use. External oracles have update delays and rely on separate node networks, which can be gameable. Neutron’s oracle is fed by the validators themselves each block, so data is fresh every few seconds (now aiming for sub-second). This reduces opportunities for price manipulation and ensures DeFi contracts (like lending, sta (Introduction - Skip) (Introduction - Skip)-to-date prices guaranteed by consensus**. Essentially, Neutron bakes the oracle into its trust model – if you trust the chain, you trust the price feeds, simplifying risk for dApp developers. (For reference, Terra had a similar validator-driven price oracle; Neutron extends this idea and also plans to allow arbitrary data feeds, e.g. randomness via VRF.)

* Q: How does the Cron module differ from using off-chain keeper bots?
 A: The Cron module guarantees execution of scheduled tasks on-chain, whereas off-chain bots (like Gelato on Ethereum or CronCat in Cosmos) introduce uncertainty. With Cron, the Neutron chain itself triggers the call at the specified block interval – there’s no chance a bot is down or late. This leads to more reliable DeFi mechanisms: e.g. automated vault rebalancing or auction clearing will happen exactly when intended, maintaining protocol liveness. Developers don’t need to incentivize third-party bots with fees or worry about network congestion preventing a critical liquidation transaction. Cron tasks are also atomic within a block – they execute with finality in the block’s EndBlock phase. By contrast, bots submit normal transactions that compete in the mempool (which could be front-run or fail). On Neutron, Cron essentially acts as a trusted scheduler, which is especially important in volatile markets where timing is critical.

* Q: What is Duality and do I need to interact with it directly?
 A: Duality is Neutron’s built-in exchange (DEX) module, which offers both AMM liquidity pools and orderbook-style orders in one venue. It’s “enshrined” in the sense that it’s a core module (like how Osmosis chain has a built-in AMM). As a developer, you don’t need to deploy your own DEX contract – you can integrate with Duality via transactions or queries. For example, if your dApp needs to swap tokens or provide liquidity, you can call Duality’s execute messages (through CosmWasm bindings or via IBC) to do so. This saves development time and ensures you benefit from the aggregated liquidity in Duality (all apps share one big liquidity pool instead of fragmenting into separate ones). Duality is optimized and audited, so leveraging it can also be safer and more performant than a custom DEX contract. Essentially, Neutron provides a ready-to-use DeFi primitive so you can focus on your app’s unique logic.

* **Q: How did the Mercury upgrade affect validators and s ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum) A: Mercury transitioned Neutron from Replicated Security (ICS) to self-security. Before, Cosmos Hub’s validators were validating Neutron, and Neutron had to send 25% of fees to the Hub as “rent”. Now, Neutron has its own validators staking NTRN, and all fees/inflation stay within Neutron’s economy. This freed Neutron from the Hub’s constraints (e.g., now Neutron can push upgrades without Hub approval and scale performance parameters freely【1 ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum) practical terms for developers: governance and upgrades might happen faster on Neutron, and chain parameters (like gas costs, block times) can be tuned for DeFi workloads. However, initially only 20 validators are active post-Mercury, chosen to ensure stability during the migration. Security is maintained by these validators’ NTRN stake and the economic incentives (3% staking APR, plus the base compensation from the Neutron Foundation). Slashing for faults is temporarily off, meaning in the short term Neutron relies on trusted validators – but as the validator set grows and slashing is reinstated, it will approach the security model typical of Cosmos chains (Byzantine-fault tolerant and economically secured by NTRN’s value). In summary, Mercury gave Neutron full control and the ability to innovate faster, at the cost of taking on the responsibility of its own security. Developers should keep an eye on Neutron’s validator set growth and decentralization (for example, if you’re building a protocol, you might want to participate in governance to ensure the oracle module stays robust and validators behave well in providing data).

* Q: Where can I find the code for these modules (Cron, Oracle, etc.) to better understand or contribute?
 A: Neutron’s core chain code is open-source on GitHub under the neutron-org organization. The main repository neutron-org/neutron contains Cosmos SDK modules specific to Neutron. For instance, you can review the Cron module implementation in the [x/cron directory】 of that repo, which defines how messages are scheduled and executed at end-block. The Oracle module code (often, Cosmos SDK oracles are under x/oracle) can also be found in the same repo – it will show how validators’ price votes are collected and how prices become queryable to contracts. Additionally, Neutron’s CosmWasm bindings are in a separate repo neutron-org/neutron-sdk, which provides Rust APIs for contracts to interact with these native modules. For example, it has packages for interchain queries, transactions, and likely for Oracle queries as well. By browsing these repositories, you can see proto definitions, message types, and hooks used by Cron and Oracle. Understanding the code can help in writing advanced contracts that, say, query the oracle each execute or coordinate cross-chain transactions (which ties into later modules). Moreover, if you’re planning to contribute to Neutron’s development or write technical documentation, referencing the source (with code snippets in docs) will help make the documentation precise and developer-trustworthy.

Documentation Structure Recommendations
For Neutron’s docs, it’s wise to separate conceptual overviews of these integrated modules from the how-to guides. For example:
   * Concept Reference Docs: Create dedicated pages like “Neutron Oracle Module” and “Cron Module” under a “Core Modules” section. These pages should explain what each module does, its architecture, and how it compares to external alternatives. Include details from Mercury (e.g. update frequency, performance stats) so readers see the value. Preserve technical specifics such as performance thresholds for validators, but perhaps in a sidebar or advanced section.

   * Developer Guides/Tutorials: Even though Oracle and Cron are mostly under-the-hood, provide guides on using them. For Oracle, a short tutorial “Querying Neutron’s Price Oracle in a Smart Contract” could show a simple CosmWasm contract that uses deps.querier.query(...) to get the latest price of an asset via a custom query to the oracle module. This makes it hands-on for deve (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)ron, since only governance/DAO can register tasks, a guide coul (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum) process: e.g., “Scheduling a DeFi contract call with Cron” – outline how a proposal or sudo call from the DAO could register a contract (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog) (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)the contract needs to handle (like being callable by Cron). Even if regular devs can’t directly trigger Cron, understanding the flow helps them design contracts that might get whitelisted for Cron by governance.

   * FAQ section: Include an FAQ in docs covering questions like those above (Oracle v (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)etc.). This helps DevRel to quickly address common queries. Some of the Q&A above can directly inspire those entries.

   * Module API Reference: In a reference section, document the exact messages, queries, and parameters of Cron and Oracle modules. E.g., list the governance parameters (Cron interval limit, etc.) and the CLI/Tx commands (if any) to interact with them. For Oracle, list how price votes work, which denom feeds exist, how a contract query result is structured (perhaps link to the proto or neutron-std types for price).

   * Performance & Upgrade Notes: It’s also useful to have a “Mercury Upgrade Changes” summary page (or a changelog) in docs that notes “Block gas increased to 330M, multi-denom fees enabled (see Module 7), etc.” – with Oracle and Cron improvements included. This contextualizes the current state for readers who knew Neutron in the ICS era.

By structuring docs this way, you provide both high-level understanding (for architects and decision-makers to see Neutron’s advantages) and low-level guidance (for builders to integrate these features). Remember to use analogies (like the ones above) in conceptual docs to drive the point home for broad audiences. For example, a docs page might start: “Neutron’s Cron is like a decentralized scheduler that guarantees your task runs on time, every time – akin to a built-in cron ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum)mart contracts.” Such framing is very DevRel-friendly.
Relevant Code & Further Reading
      * Neutron Core Repository: Review the Neutron chain code on GitHub – neutron-org/neutron (Go code). Specifically, check out:

         * x/cron module code (to see how messages are registered and executed).

         * x/interchainqueries and x/interchaintxs (these relate to cross-chain features, covered in Module 3).

         * (If present) x/oracle or any oracle-related files (to see how price data flows).

         * app/app.go and config files to see Mercury’s parameter changes (e.g., MaxGas set to 330M).

            * Neutron CosmWasm SDK: neutron-org/neutron-sdk (Rust) – provides helpers for CosmWasm contracts on Neutron. Look at the bindings package and any mention of Oracle or Cron there. For example, if contracts can query the Oracle, there will be a query struct defined for it.

            * Neutron Docs (current): The official docs at docs.neutron.org might still reflect the ICS era. Notably, a section on Overview mentions cross-chain features and fee distribution (25% to Hub) which is outdated post-Mercury. As you restructure docs, ensure to update those parts. Use Mercury proposal posts for accurate info (e.g., Stakecito’s blog for rationale).

            * Cosmos SDK & CosmWasm References: Since Neutron is built on these, linking to Cosmos SDK documentation for general concepts (modules, multi-store, etc.) can help newbies. Also, CosmWasm’s official docs and the CosmWasm Plus contracts library (for standard contract implementations) are useful references for Module 2 and Module 6.

Module 2: CosmWasm Smart Contract Development on Neutron
Technical Overview
Neutron uses CosmWasm as its smart contract platform, allowing developers to write contracts in Rust that compile to WebAssembly. If you’ve built on Terra, Juno, or Osmosis’s contract layer, the experience on Neutron is similar – but with additional capabilities and considerations unique to Neutron. At its core, CosmWasm provides a secure sandbox for contract execution: contracts can hold state, execute messages, and query data. Neutron’s runtime currently supports CosmWasm 1.0+ (aligned with Cosmos SDK v0.45+), and Mercury likely upgraded it to the latest stable version for performance/stability. The execution environment inherits Cosmos safety features (e.g. gas metering to prevent infinite loops, and memory sandboxing to prevent one contract from affecting another).
Writing a contract: You’ll typically use the standard CosmWasm develop (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum) (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)r msg (execute m query interfaces, and state structures in Rust, then implement the entry points (instantiate, execute, query) with business logic. Neutron doesn’t change this process, but extends what your contract can do. Thanks to Neutron’s custom bindings and SDK, contracts on Neutron can perform cross-chain calls (via interchain accounts/queries) and can interact with Neutron’s modules (like triggering a swap on Duality or reading from the Oracle). For example, Neutron provides a neutron_sdk::bindings::NeutronMsg type that includes variants for InterchainTx messages – a contract can send one of these to instruct the chain to execute a transaction on a remote chain over IBC. These advanced message types augment the usual CosmWasm CosmosMsg set (which covers bank transfers, staking, etc.) with cross-chain capabilities. We’ll delve in (neutron-sdk 0.11.1 - Docs.rs)in in Module 3, but it’s (neutron-sdk 0.11.1 - Docs.rs)note here: Neutron contracts can natively speak IBC without needing external relayers in their design (beyond the relayer infrastructure that Neutron already has).
Another Neutron-specific extension is the ability for contracts to query Neutron’s modules. Using deps.querier with custom querier types from the Neutron SDK, your contract can fetch, say, th (Introduction - Skip) (Introduction - Skip)cle module or the result of an interchain query. This is different from a typical Cosmos chain where contracts might only query other contracts or base modules indirectly; Neutron exposes cross-module queries in a standardized way via CosmWasm. Essentially, the contract environment on Neutron is *CosmWasm (Neutron: From Interchain Security to Full Sovereignty - StakeCito)rything you can do on a normal CosmWasm chain plus enshrined infra and cross-chain ops.
Neutron’s transaction lifecycle for contracts remains standard: users (or other contracts) submit MsgExecuteContract transactions to invoke a contract, which gets processed in the CosmWasm VM. Gas costs on Neutron for contracts are comparable to other Cosmos chains (each wasm opcode or API call has a gas charge). However, because Neutron raised its block gas limit to 330M, contracts on Neutron can perform much heavier computations or handle more complex logic in one transaction than before. This is a boon for developers of advanced protocols (like on-chain order matching or simulations) that might have been impossible under tight gas limits. Keep in mind: with great gas comes great responsibility – as a DevRel engineer, you should caution developers to still optimize their contracts, since a single transaction can’t exceed the block gas limit and sending extremely heavy compute might still fail if it doesn’t fit in 330M gas.
Contract deployment and interaction on Neutron use the same messages as on other CosmWasm-enabled chains:
               * MsgStoreCode to upload WASM bytecode (this stores code on-chain and yields a code ID).

               * MsgInstantiateContract to instantiate a contract with a given code ID and initial state.

               * MsgExecuteContract to call an existing contract. Neutron inherits these from Cosm (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)hanges. One Mercury-related note: since Neutron is now sovereign, it has its own governance and security around code uploads. Under ICS, the Hub had some indirect oversight, but now Neutron’s governance solely controls permissions like who can upload code (Neutron likely is permissionless for contract deployment – as it was intended to be a permissionless CosmWasm zone, and that should remain post-sovereignty).

From a code perspective, developers will use the Neutron TS/JS and Rust SDKs to interact and build on Neutron. The Rust neutron-sdk helps in writing contracts (with the special message/query types as described), and the TypeScript neutronjs or chain-ts-client can assist in front-end or integration development (these likely provide ready-made classes to call Neutron’s cosmwasm contracts and modules). The existence of these SDKs means the Neutron team has prepared a developer-friendly interface – highlight this in documentation: “Don’t start from scratch – use our SDK for common tasks.”
In summary, developing CosmWasm on Neutron involves writing Rust smart contracts as usual but being able to tap into Neutron’s “superpowers” (cross-chain calls, oracle data, scheduled execution) via provided libraries. The fundamental model (Rust/wasm, execute and query messages, gas metering) remains the same as any CosmWasm chain, ensuring that Cosmos developers feel at home, while Ethereum developers will need to adjust to a new language and paradigm (addressed in comparisons below).
Mercury Enhancements
Mercury’s upgrades primarily affected the chain’s infrastructure around contracts rather than the contract API itself. So, the way you develop a contract didn’t change, but what you can expect from the chain did improve:
                  * Higher Gas Per Block: As noted, 330M gas per block means contract calls can do more. For example, if a complex De (Privy – Wallet infrastructure, built for scale.) (Build a Seamless Web3 login, Non-custodial wallet (PrivySDK + ...) risked hitting the 30M gas limit with too many operation (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)data, heavy math), that risk is now much lower. This opens the door to more on-chain computation. Mercury explicitly frames this as enabling things like “perpetual futures clusters” – likely meaning you could have many perpetual swap contracts all running and updating positions atomically on Neutron, something previously too costly.

                  * Faster Execution/Finality: Block time heading towards 0.1s means that contract calls finalize extremely fast. This is a UX improvement – users calling a contract (swap, deposit, etc.) get confirmation almost instantly, comparable to a Web2 app’s response time. For developers, it means you can design dApps that feel snappy; for example, a complex interaction (perhaps involving multiple cross-chain steps) can complete in a few seconds rather than half a minute. Also, if your contract logic depends on timing (e.g., an auction that lasts N blocks), shorter blocks give finer granularity.

                  * Improved Reliability: Mercury’s removal of the ICS overhead means fewer surprise failure modes (previously, if Cosmos Hub halted or if the connection between Hub and Neutron had issues, it could impact Neutron contract execution timing or upgrades). Now Neutron upgrades and runs independently, which likely reduced runtime interruptions. As a developer, you can be more confident that Neutron will only halt or fail in extreme cases (like any sovereign chain) and not because another chain told it to stop.

                  * Multi-Denom Gas Fees: (More on this in Module 7) – but from a contract dev perspective, Mercury allowing fees in any liquid token means users can invoke your contracts using, say, USDC or ATOM to pay gas. This doesn’t directly change contract code, but improves user onboarding. When writing tutorials, you can assume users might not have NTRN yet and instruct them accordingly. The contract itself can even query what denom paid the fee (CosmWasm env gives only gas info, not fee denom, so maybe not) – but you could imagi (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)that reimburse or track gas in various tokens if needed. Mercury’s fee flexibility plus gas discounts for NTRN/ATOM aim to e (Neutron - X)ctivity; expect more contract calls as it’s easier for users to pay for them.

                  * No functional change to CosmWasm version (as far as known public info) – Mercury notes don’t mention a CosmWasm version bump, but it’s likely Neutron was already on a modern version. If they moved to CometBFT (Tendermint) v0.37 or similar, that is underlying and mostly transparent to contracts.

In short, Mercury turbocharged the environment around the contracts. When communicating to developers: “After Mercury, Neutron contracts can run heavier logic and finalize faster – so go ahead and build that advanced strategy or calculation on-chain that you hesitated to before.” Also emphasize that the developer tooling (Rust SDK, etc.) has been updated to reflect any new message types or queries that Mercury introduced (for example, if any new Oracle query type was added).
Developer Analogy
For those coming from Ethereum: writing CosmWasm on Neutron is like switching from building with LEGO blocks to building with LEGO Technic. In Ethereum (Solidity), you have standardized bricks (ERC20, etc.) and you fit them together, but you’re somewhat limited by the EVM’s design (all logic must be in solidity or off-chain, cross-chain is not native). In CosmWasm, especially on Neutron, you get a more advanced kit with gears and motors – i.e., more built-in functionality and lower-level control. You write in Rust, which feels more low-level than Solidity, but this grants you fine-grained management of data and memory (preventing many classes of bugs). The learning curve is steeper (Rust is stricter than Solidity), but you end up with a more robust machine.
Another analogy: developing a contr (Introduction - Skip) vs Ethereum is like writing a program in a **managed, sec (Introduction - Skip)iting directly for a single-purpose device. Ethereum’s EVM is a bespoke environment with its own quirks (gas for each opcode, global shared state for contracts, etc.), whereas CosmWasm is more like a standard WebAssembly runtime inside a secure OS (Cosmos SDK). In CosmWasm, each contract is isolated (like an app in a container), you ha (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)library (cosmwasm-std) for interacting with the “OS” (blockchain state, other contracts), and the OS (Neutron chain) provides services (Oracle, Cron, etc.) that your app can call. This is akin to an app calling OS APIs for time or network, rather than having to implement them itself. So, tell developers: “Neutron’s environment lets you focus on business logic in a safe language, while the chain provides many services you’d otherwise implement as contracts or off-chain bots on Ethereum.”
For Cosmos SDK veterans: writing contracts on Neutron is like using a high-level scripting language on top of the SDK. Instead of writing a full SDK module in Golang for every feature, you can deliver features as CosmWasm contracts – faster to iterate – and still achieve performance thanks to Mercury’s optimizations. And if you need something usually only a chain module could do (like send an IBC transfer or query another chain), Neutron’s CosmWasm gives you hooks for that too. It blurs the line between being a chain developer and a contract developer.
Key Developer Q&A
                     * Q: I’m an Ethereum Solidity developer – how hard is it to start building on Neutron (CosmWasm)?
 A: There’s a learning curve, but it’s manageable with the right resources. CosmWasm uses Rust, which is a different language (memory-safe, compiled, no garbage collection) compared to Solidity. You’ll need to get comfortable with Rust’s concepts (ownership, option/result types, etc.) and the CosmWasm framework (which provides convenient macros and types for contract development). Many Ethereum devs find Rust challenging at first, but it prevents entire categories of bugs like null-pointer dereferences and integer overflows by design. The good news is that CosmWasm’s patterns (instantiate/execute/query) will feel somewhat familiar to writing contract functions in Solidity, just with more explicit handling of state and types. You’ll also find parallels: for example, a CW20 contract (the CosmWasm equivalent of ERC-20) has a similar interface (balance, transfer, allowance) but is implemented in Rust. To help, Neutron’s team and community likely have templates and examples – you can start by copying a simple counter or token contract and modifying it. The Neutron (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum) will include guides for environment setup, and you can use familiar tools like Docker (for running local nodes or tests) and JavaScript SDKs (for sending transactions, just like web3.js). Additionally, cosmwasm-plus repository provides many common contracts (DEX, tokens, etc.) as open source, which you can study or even repurpose. In short: expect to invest some time to learn Rust and CosmWasm conventions, but once you do, you’ll appreciate the stronger safety and the powerful features (like multi-chain integration) it unlocks. Many developers report that after the initial hurdle, they can develop features more confidently in CosmWasm because the language and framework catch many errors at compile time that would only show up at runtime in Solidity.

                     * Q: How do I test and deploy my smart contracts on Neutron?
 A: Testing CosmWasm contracts is typically done in two ways: off-chain unit tests in Rust, and integration tests against a local blockchain. Off-chain, you can write Rust tests that call your contract logic directly (mocking the environment) – CosmWasm provides a framework for this, which is great for testing contract logic without running a node. For integration tests or just playing with your contract, you’d run a local Neutron node or use Neutron’s testnet. The Neutron team likely provides a Docker image or instructions for spinning up a local devnet (since Neutron is Cosmos SDK based, tools like ignite or simd might be adapted for Neutron). After writing and compiling your contract (cargo wasm produces the .wasm), you use CLI commands or the Neutron JS SDK to store the code on-chain, then instantiate it. On testnet, you’ll need some testnet NTRN for fees – there’s usually a faucet. The process is similar to deploying to Testnet in Ethereum (just different CLI and keys). Neutron’s documentation should have a step-by-step “Hello World” example – e.g., deploying a basic counter contract – which you can follow. One Mercury-specific tip: because Neutron now allows paying fees in multiple tokens, if you don’t have NTRN handy even on testnet, you might be able to pay fees in ATOM or another token if the testnet is configured similarly (check docs for accepted fee tokens on testnet). For mainnet deployment, ensure your contract is well-tested and consider security audits, as Neutron is a finance-focused chain and users will rely on your contracts. The upload/instantiate/execute steps are all permissionless on Neutron (anyone can deploy a contract), which is by design to foster innovation.

                     * Q: How can my Neutron contract call another contract, or a module like the DEX?
 A: In CosmWasm, one contract can call another by sending a CosmosMsg::Wasm(MsgExecuteContract{...}) within its execution. Neutron fully supports this – so you can have contracts composing with each other (for instance, a vault contract calling a DEX contract to swap). When it comes to calling chain modules (like the Duality DEX or bank transfers), CosmWasm abstracts those as well. For example, to perform a token transfer from within a contract, you return a CosmosMsg::Bank(BankMsg::Send{...}) from your execute function. Similarly, if Duality is exposed to contracts, it might be through custom message types registered in the Neutron bindings. Neutron’s neutron-sdk likely defines messages like NeutronMsg::Swap or similar (if they provided a direct hook to Duality), or more generally, you might have to call Duality via an ICS transaction (since Duality is a module, one way might be a contract telling the chain “execute this swap message on my behalf”). If that’s abstract, don’t worry – Neutron’s docs and SDK would provide concrete examples. It’s possible that some DeFi functionality (like Duality) is easier accessed via direct contract calls if Duality itself is implemented as a CosmWasm contract (though from context it sounds like a native module). If it’s a native module, you might use an interop approach: Neutron could expose a special wasmbindings entry point for it (some Cosmos chains do that, e.g., Osmosis had ways to call its AMM from CosmWasm). This is an area where you’d consult Neutron’s developer docs or ask in the community forums for patterns. Key point: Neutron is built to allow rich interaction between contracts and modules. Many tasks that would be impossible on other chains (like a contract initiating an IBC transfer or querying another chain) are possible here. For instance, your contract can initiate an interchain query by calling into the interchain query module with the right message (Neutron’s SDK provides NeutronMsg::InterchainQuery and then the contract will get a callback with results – more in Module 3). For calling the Oracle, you don’t even need to send a message – just use deps.querier.query::<PriceResponse>(OracleQuery{asset: ...}) (pseudo-code) to get the latest price. This happens within your contract execution synchronously. In summary, Neutron gives contracts a lot of powers, and the SDK’s job is to package those powers in easy-to-use methods. As a DevRel, you’ll likely prepare code snippets demonstrating these interactions (like a snippet showing a cross-contract call or an oracle query) for the documentation.

                     * Q: Are there any differences in how state works or how data is stored in Neutron’s CosmWasm versus elsewhere?
 A: Under the hood, CosmWasm stores contract data in the Cosmos SDK’s multi-store (specifically under a prefix for the x/wasm module). Neutron doesn’t fundamentally alter this. One thing to be aware of is contract address format: Neutron’s contract addresses will be Bech32 strings with prefix neutron… (just like account addresses). They are derived from your instantiator address and the code ID. This is standard for CosmWasm on any chain (addresses are algorithmically generated). If you’re used to Ethereum’s 0x… addresses, be aware that in Cosmos each chain has its own human-readable prefix and the addresses encode the public key data. You don’t usually need to worry about the conversion, as libraries handle it, but it’s why an address looks longer/different. As for state, each contract’s data is isolated. There is no global storage like Ethereum’s mappings between contracts – instead, if contracts need to share data, they either call each other or use a common contract as a datastore. Neutron doesn’t change that model, but its cross-chain features allow contracts to even pull in state from other blockchains (which is novel!). Also, note that contract execution in CosmWasm is deterministic and thus certain things like random number generation require an external source (like the Oracle module might provide VRF randomness in future, or contracts use prev block hashes). Ethereum devs might be used to reading block.timestamp for time or blockhash for randomness – in CosmWasm, you’d get current block time from the env (which is fine) and for randomness, often a combination of known sources plus external injection is needed. Neutron’s integrated oracle may eventually supply a randomness oracle which contracts can query in one block and use in the next.

                     * Q: How does cross-chain contract development differ? (Although this is Module 3, a quick mention):
A: On Neutron, a contract can initiate IBC actions. That means your mental model of a contract expands: it’s not just confined to Neutron’s state. For example, you could write a cont (Introduction - Skip)s funds on Neutron but opens an interchain account on Osmosis to stake those funds in an Osmosis pool, all from Neutron. This is achieved by the contract sending an MsgExecuteContract with a special message that the x/interchain-txs module interprets to do an IBC call. The result comes back via a callback to your contract. This pattern is powerful but complex – essentially your contract has an async step (initiate IBC, then later a callback). Developers should carefully manage these flows (store some state to know an IBC transfer is in progress, handle the callback to finalize). Neutron’s SDK and examples will be invaluable here. It’s recommended to start with simpler use of cross-chain features (like an interchain query to retrieve data, which is easier to manage) then move to interchain accounts which involve controlling another chain. We’ll detail this in Module 3, but be aware that Neutron’s contract dev spans multi-chain logic, which is quite unique.

Documentation Structure Recommendations
Given the breadth of CosmWasm development, documentation should be divided to cater to both newcomers and experienced devs:
                        * Tutorials (Hands-on): Create a progressive tutorial series:

                           * “Your First Contract on Neutron” – covering setting up Rust, writing a basic contract (e.g., increment counter), deploying it on testnet, and calling it. Include steps to use Neutron’s testnet faucet and CLI or a simple script with neutron.js to interact. (Introduction - Skip)quivalent of Ethereum’s “Hello World” but in CosmWasm.

                           * “Integrating Neutron Modules in Contracts” – e.g., a tutorial where you write a contract that queries the Oracle for price and executes a swap on Duality if price conditions meet (a simplistic arbitrage bot example, perhaps). This would demonstrate using Neutron’s bindings for oracle query and an execute message to Duality. Even if not fully fleshed out, showing how to import neutron_sdk and use NeutronMsg::… will demystify it.

                           * “Cross-Chain Contract Calls” – bridging to Module 3, a tutorial for interchain queries or transactions from a contract perspective. Possibly an example: a contract on Neutron that checks a user’s staking balance on the Cosmos Hub chain via interchain query (demonstrating how to register query and handle response).

                           * Advanced: “Building an Automated Vault with Cron” – illustrate how a contract can benefit from Cron. Since Cron registration is permissioned, this could be more explanatory: e.g., “if the community grants Cron access to your contract, here’s how you’d design your contract’s execute to handle a cron call (maybe (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)cuteMsg variant that anyone (Cron) can call to perform rebalancing).”

                              * These tutorials should be in the “Getting Started” or “Build on Neutron” section of docs, giving step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and expected outcomes.

                              * Reference & How-to Guides: Have a section in docs specifically for CosmWasm on Neutron. Topics to cover:

                                 * Setting up the development environment (Rust toolchain, proper CosmWasm version matching Neutron’s, etc.).

                                 * Testing contracts (with links to cosmwasm docs plus Neutron-specific tips if any).

                                 * Deploying to testnet/mainnet (including how to get test tokens, which explorers to use to verify contracts).

                                 * Using Neutron’s Rust SDK in your contract (document the available features: e.g., an entry for “Interchain Accounts in contracts” that explains the message flow, with code).

                                 * Migration of contracts (CosmWasm supports migrate messages to upgrade a contract in-place). If Neutron uses that (likely yes), explain how developers can upgrade their contracts post-deployment with governance or their own privileges.

                                    * API Reference: All the additional message types and query types that Neutron adds should be documented. Perhaps a table or list of Neutron Custom CosmWasm Messages:

                                       * e.g., NeutronMsg::RegisterInterchainAccount, NeutronMsg::SubmitTX, NeutronMsg::RegisterInterchainQuery, etc., with explanation of each. Similarly, Neutron Custom Queries like querying interchain query results, etc.

                                       * Document the structure of Oracle query (e.g., if a contract wants price of ATOM: how to format the query and what the response contains).

                                          * Comparisons & Best Practices: A guide “CosmWasm vs Ethereum Development” might be useful to help those transitioning. Outline differences in language, dev lifecycle (compile vs interpret, unit testing with Rust vs Solidity tests etc.), and common pitfalls (for example, a big one: CosmWasm’s contract execution is atomic per message, no concept of a transaction spanning multiple blocks unless you do async IBC flows – compare that to Ethereum where a tx is one shot anyway but some might expect to schedule things differently).

                                             * Also mention tooling differences: “Instead of Hardhat/Truffle, you’ll use Cargo for builds and possibly wasmd CLI or CosmJS for deployment.”

                                                * Security considerations: Because Neutron expects serious DeFi usage, include a section on writing secure CosmWasm contracts (avoid state bloat, be mindful of gas especially with 330M limit – just because you have more gas doesn’t mean you should burn it unnecessarily, watch out for reentrancy logic even though CosmWasm by default doesn’t have cross-contract reentran (Neutron · GitHub) Ethereum – because calls are depth-bounded and no concurrent execution, but if you call out to another contract, you must still handle the response carefully). Mention that CosmWasm eliminates many Ethereum bugs (like buffer overflows, unchecked math) because Rust and cosmwasm-std handle those, but logic bugs can still happen.

Given that the user (DevRel engineer) will restructure docs, these pointers can guide what sections to create. Importantly, separate Tutorials (which are sequential and multi-step) from Reference (which is more encyclopedia style). Perhaps use the Diátaxis documentation framework: Tutorials, How-To Guides, Explanations, Reference – that might resonate.
Relevant Code & Further Reading
                                                   * CosmWasm Documentation: The official CosmWasm Book is a great resource for understanding how to write and deploy contracts. It includes tutorials and explanation of concepts (like message handling, storage, etc.).

                                                   * Neutron Contracts Examples: If available, refer to any example contracts written by Neutron core or community. For instance, Neutron might have sample contracts (like the airdrop distributor contract or others in their GitHub). Studying those can show best practices. The neutron-org/neutron-integration-tests repo might contain example contract code or scripts that simulate contract calls.

                                                   * cosmwasm-plus and cw-hooks: The CosmWasm Plus repository has ready-made contracts (CW20 token, CW20 bonding, etc.). These are very useful as starting points for asset issuers (Module 6). They also illustrate patterns like contract-to-contract calls and using hooks for callbacks.

                                                   * Neutron’s CosmWasm SDK crate docs: We saw an overview in docs.rs. It breaks down packages for interchain queries, interchain transactions, sudo (for callbacks), etc. Developers should read these sections for details on how to craft messages in Rust. Provide links to these or excerpt key parts in Neutron’s own docs.

                                                   * Community resources: Mention Neutron’s developer Discord or forum for asking questions, since sometimes debugging CosmWasm issues can require quick help. Also, if any hackathon or workshop content exists (slides or code) from Cosmoverse or Hackmos, those could be referenced for practical tips.

                                                   * IBC and Cross-chain guides: For cross-chain specific code (which is partly contract dev and partly understanding IBC), refer to resources in Module 3.

By combining these references, developers will have a 360° view: theoretical knowledge from docs, practical from tutorials, and real code from examples.
Module 3: Cross-Chain Infrastructure (IBC, Interchain Queries/Accounts & Security Model)
Technical Overview
Neutron is deeply integrated into the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, enabling first-class cross-chain capabilities. In fact, Neutron was born as an “Interchain” smart contract hub – it not only connects to other blockchains to transfer tokens, but allows smart contracts to directly interact with other chains in trust-minimized ways. Let’s break down the key cross-chain components:
                                                      * IBC Transport Layer: At its base, Neutron speaks IBC, the Cosmos protocol for transferring data packets between chains. IBC provides a reliable, ordered channel once two chains handshake a connection. It’s the foundation for everything cross-chain: token transfers, interchain queries, etc., all ride over IBC.

                                                      * ICS-20 Token Transfers: Neutron fully supports ICS-20 (the IBC token transfer standard). This means Neutron can send and receive fungible tokens from other IBC-enabled chains trustlessly. For example, ATOM from the Cosmos Hub can be transferred to Neutron over IBC and vice versa. The Neutron chain keeps a light client of the other chain and verifies proofs of token escrow, ensuring no double-spends or fraudulent transfers. From a dev perspective, ICS-20 transfers allow your Neutron dApp to utilize assets from across the Cosmos ecosystem (and even beyond, via bridges). Many assets like USDC (from Noble chain) or BTC (via Nomic or Axelar bridges) can appear on Neutron as IBC tokens. The transfer process can be done by users via wallets (Kepl...via wallets (Keplr, Cosmostation, etc.) or programmatically. For developers, ICS-20 means you can onboard assets into your Neutron dApp from any connected chain easily – users just IBC transfer their tokens to Neutron and your contract can then use them (e.g., a user sends ATOM to Neutron, then your contract could put tha (Privy – Wallet infrastructure, built for scale.) (Build a Seamless Web3 login, Non-custodial wallet (PrivySDK + ...)eld strategy).

                                                      * Interchain Accounts (ICA): This feature (part of ICS-27 spec) lets Neutron create and control an account on a remote chain. In practice, a Neutron smart contract can open an ICA on another IBC-connected chain and send it transactions. It’s like having a “remote control” for other blockchains. For example, a Neutron contract could open an account on Osmosis and execute trades or provide liquidity on Osmosis via IBC, all triggered from Neutron. The magic is that the Neutron chain packs the remote instructions into IBC packets and a relayer delivers them; the remote chain (Osmosis) executes them as if a local account did, and returns a result acknowledgement. This allows multi-chain dApps: a contract on Neutron orchestrating activity on many zones. Use cases include cross-chain DeFi (one contract managing positions on multiple chains), remote staking or governance (Neutron could delegate tokens on other chains, etc.). The Neutron SDK provides message types like MsgRegisterInterchainAccount and MsgSubmitTx (with a protobuf of the remote chain’s transaction) to handle this. The Neutron chain’s x/interchaintxs module (ICTX) executes these safely, and a callback (acknowledgment) can be delivered to the originating contract to confirm success or failure.

                                                      * Interchain Queries (ICQ): Part of Neutron’s arsenal (in ICS-31 proposals) is the ability for contracts to query state from other chains. A contract on Neutron can ask: “What is the account balance of X on chain Y?” or “Find transactions matching XYZ on chain Z,” and get an answer back, trustlessly. The x/interchainqueries module on Neutron registers such queries via IBC to a target chain’s query endpoint. Third-party relayers then periodically fetch the requested data and submit proofs back to Neutron. Neutron verifies the proof using the stored light client of that chain (so the data is trustless), and then delivers the query result to the requesting contract via a special CosmWasm callback (Sudo message). For example, a Neutron contract could query the Cosmos Hub for a user’s staked ATOM and then, upon receiving it, make decisions (like gating access to some feature if ATOM stake > threshold). This is powerful: it’s like giving Neutron contracts read-access to the global state of the interchain. Use cases include cross-chain oracles (fetch price from a DEX on another chain), airdrops (snapshot balances from various chains), or verifying NFT ownership across chains for access control. ICQs are asynchronous – you register a query and get results later – but Neutron’s infrastructure handles the heavy lifting (with the Neutron Query (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)ice).

These two (ICA and ICQ) together form what you might call Neutron’s Cross-Chain SDK. They are enshrined capabilities that most other CosmWasm chains don’t have at this level. ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum), it means you can build applications that operate across multiple chains without users having to leave Neutron. All they do is interact with Neutron contracts, and under the hood those contracts drive logic on other chains.
                                                         * IBC Security Model: IBC itself is trust-minimized but has certain security assumptions. It relies on each chain running a light client of the other. Neutron, like other cosmos chains, maintains a light client for each connected chain (tracking its headers). If either chain’s validator set is compromised (e.g., 1/3+ Byzantine for BFT), IBC can be exploited (fake proofs accepted). Neutron’s core devs and Interchain developers are aware of this and there are mitigation efforts (like upgrading clients, using ICS-Consumer/Provider security, etc.). But practically, when using cross-chain features, you should be aware of the trust boundaries: e.g., i (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)ct relies on data from chain X via ICQ, and chain X has weaker security, that could be a vulnerability. Similarly, controllin (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)nother chain is as secure as that chain’s honesty. Neutron will reject obviously invalid proofs, but a sufficiently broken counterparty chain could still fool a light client. Emphasize in docs that while IBC is non-custodial (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)rty), it’s not zero-risk – it’s as secure as the connected chains.

                                                         * Interchain Security (ICS) vs Sovereignty: Originally, Neutron was launched under the Cosmos Hub’s Replicated Security (ICS) program (often called ICS v1). This meant the Cosmos Hub’s validator set produced Neutron’s blocks. After Mercury, Neutron has full sovereignty – its own validators, token, and governance. The cross-chain aspect h (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)reviously Neutron had to send 25% of fees to the Cosmos Hub as part of the security lease, and any slashable events on Neutron would slash Hub validators. That dependency is now removed. Neutron’s security model is like any Cosmos PoS chain: stakers of NTRN back the chain’s security. One direct effect is Neutron no longer automatically benefits from “billions of ATOM economic security”; instead it must cultivate strong value in NTRN to deter attacks. On the flip side, Neutron can upgrade more rapidly (no waiting for Hub governance to push validator set changes) and fine-tune performance for its needs. It also embraced a more flexible future: Cosmos Hub is exploring Provider-Specific Security models (like Partial or opt-in security), which Neutron could potentially use in the future, but currently Neutron stands alone.

Asset bridging: Aside from pure IBC, Neutron can receive assets bridged from non-IBC ecosystems via intermediaries (e.g., Axelar brings Ethereum assets in as IBC tokens on Neutron). Mercury mentions expanding on-ramps: “fund new accounts <30s with USDC over Skip Go Fast, expanding to BTC, ETH, SOL this year”. This indicates Neutron is leveraging both IBC and partner services (like Skip’s API, Axelar, Wormhole maybe via Squid router) to streamline getting assets from Ethereum, Solana, etc., into Neutron. Developers don’t handle bridging logic themselves; instead, they can rely on these services or simply instruct users to use bridging UIs (like Squid, Axelar Transfer).
Finally, Neutron’s “security model” in a cross-chain sense also involves how it manages its own state and upgrades. Mercury improved (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)y simplifying the code (removing ICS module) and by adding safeguards like rate-limiting IBC queries (to prevent spam) and ensuring fast halts if anything goes wrong. The governance proposal for Mercury was heavily tested on testnet (pion-1) and audited, underscoring Neutron’s commitment to security during such transitions.
Developer Analogy
Consider Neutron as a “universal remote control” for the Interchain. Normally, if you want to use multiple blockchains, it’s like having separate TVs – each with its own remote. You’d have to pick up the Ethereum remote to do something on Ethereum, then the Cosmos remote for Cosmos. With Neutron, your smart contract can be that fancy universal remote that’s programmed to control many devices. Interchain Accounts are like having a drone that flies to another city (chain) and presses buttons for you there, then comes back with the results. Interchain Queries are like calling a read-only API on another database – except it’s trustless and verifiable, more akin to getting a notarized letter from another chain with the info you need. In simpler terms, Neutron abstracts away the walls between blockchains for developers: you can read and write across chains almost as if it’s one big extended state.
Another analogy: Neutron (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)gn vs ICS is like moving from a rented apartment to your own house. In the apartment (ICS), some rules were set by the landlord (Cosmos Hub) – like quiet hours (upgrade schedules) and rent (fee share). In your own house (sovereign L1), you make all the rules but also must handle your own security system. You no longer pay rent but you invest in an alarm (your validator incentives). You can renovate whenever you want (upgrade faster) and build extensions (integrate new features) without asking permission. But you also need to maintain the property (grow NTRN value to secure it). For cross-chain devs, this means Neutron will be very agile in adding new IBC features or upgrading to new ICS standards, since it’s no longer tied to the Hub’s pace. Neutron can truly become an interchain hub for DeFi, coordinating with the Hub as a partner rather than a dependent.
Key Developer Q&A
                                                            * Q: How do I perform an IBC token transfer in my dApp or contract?
 A: If you just need to move tokens, users can do it manually via wallets (it’s like a deposit/withdrawal flow: send from origin chain to Neutron’s IBC address, etc.). However, you might want to initiate transfers programmatically (e.g., your contract sends funds out). In CosmWasm, you can’t directly initiate an IBC transfer from a contract without an intermediary, unless you have an ICA on the target chain. But typically, the pattern is:

                                                               1. For incoming assets: Provide users with the IBC channel details and the Neutron address to send to (this can be in your frontend UI). Once the tokens arrive (they appear as ibc/ denom on Neutron), your contracts can recognize and use them (you might query balances or have a deposit contract).

                                                               2. For outgoing assets: You might build a service or use a relayer API to have Neutron send tokens out. Alternatively, you use an Interchain Account on Neutron itself (on some connection) to execute a token transfer from that account to another chain. This can get complex – often it’s easier to instruct the user to withdraw manually.

                                                                  * A simpler approach for devs is to integrate with bridging/transfer SDKs like Skip’s API or Squid router. For example, Skip provides a Go API that can compose multi-hop transfers behind the scenes. This means from your frontend you could let a user “Teleport asset X from Chain A to Neutron” with one click. Skip figures out the route (maybe using Axelar + IBC) and returns a transaction or executes it. As a dApp developer, leveraging such services (through REST (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)s often easier than writing all logic on-chain. Summarily: On-chain, contracts handle IBC via ICA/ICQ not direct ICS-20, but off-chain you can streamline asset bridging with available infrastructure.

                                                                  * Q: What does Neutron’s “rebranded IBC” mean?
 A: The user question hints at “rebranded IBC, asset transfer, security model” – likely meaning we should present IBC in approachable terms. Neutron might want to avoid drowning developers in acronym soup. In documentation or dev-rel material, you might simply call this “Cross-Chain Integration”. The technology is IBC, but you can explain it without assuming prior knowledge: e.g., “Neutron uses an interoperability protocol to talk to other blockchains trustlessly.” So rebranding IBC could just mean renaming features in a more descriptive way. For instance, call Interchain Accounts “Remote Accounts”, Interchain Queries “Cross-chain Queries”, etc., in user-facing docs (with the ICS terms in parentheses for those who want to dig deeper). The asset transfer piece is straightforward – just ensure to document how to get common assets to Neutron (maybe an “Asset Transfer Guide” showing using Keplr UI or CLI for ICS-20). As for the security model, rebranding it might mean articulating the switch from Hub security to Neutron’s own security in positive terms (Neutron as a sovereign PoS network now). So, the answer here: Neutron’s cross-chain features are indeed IBC under the hood, but we present them as built-in cross-chain APIs. The developer doesn’t have to manually handle light clients or proofs – Neutron abstracts that. Focus on what they achieve (multi-chain swaps, queries, etc.) rather than the protocol name.

                                                                  * Q: How do I use Interchain Queries (ICQ) as a developer?
 A: Using ICQs involves both on-chain contract code and off-chain relayer support. If you’re writing a contract that needs data from chain B:

                                                                     1. In your contract’s execute logic, you would call a function to register an interchain query. The Neutron SDK provides a message for this, e.g., NeutronMsg::RegisterInterchainQuery { query_type, keys, etc. }. You specify the target chain, the data you want (like a store key for a KV query, or a TX filter for a transactions query), and an update interval (how often to fetch).

                                                                     2. When your contract returns this message, the Neutron chain’s ICQ module processes it: it opens an IBC channel to the target if not open, and stores the query info.

                                                                     3. A relayer (Neutron Query Relayer) sees the new query and will deliver the query result at the specified interval. On res (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)will deliver a Sudo callback to your contract with either SudoKVQueryResult or SudoTXQueryResult containing the data.

                                                                     4. You implement the sudo entry point in your contract to handle this. (In CosmWasm, sudo is a privileged callback that can only be invoked by the chain itself for special events; Neutron enables these for ICQ results).

                                                                     5. In that handler, you take ([IDEA] Enshrined Infra for Neutron dApps - Ideas - Neutron Forum) say, update your contract’s state or trigger some action.

                                                                        * The key is that your contract must be prepared for asynchronous response. If your contract needed the data before proceeding with something, you might split the logic: one message to request the data, then when sudo comes with result, issue another message (perhaps using Cron or user action) to continue the process now that you have the info.

Alternatively, if you don't want to write a CosmWasm contract for this and just want to query another chain from Neutron’s backend, you could run the query via Neutron’s CLI or an off-chain script using neutrond tx interchainqueries commands. But for most product use-cases, wrapping it in a contract is cleaner and automatic.

The Neutron docs should include sample code for ICQ. Possibly a snippet where a contract queries a balance on another chain is very instructive. Also mention to devs: ensure a relayer is running for your query. The Neutron Foundation or community likely runs public ICQ relayers for mainnet, but on testnet you might need to run one yourself or trigger manually. However, that’s more devops than development; the contract part is as above.

                                                                        * Q: How do Interchain Accounts work for executing transactions on other chains?
 A: Interchain Accounts let your contract effectively act as a user on another chain. The flow is:

                                                                           1. Your contract (or an off-chain controller) registers an ICA on a target chain. This opens an IBC channel and establishes a new account (address) on the target chain that’s controlled by Neutron’s ICA module (on behalf of your contract).

                                                                           2. To use it, your contract composes a transaction message that the remote chain will understand. For instance, if the remote chain is Osmosis and you want to swap, you’d create an Osmosis MsgSwap (protobuf). You then wrap it in Neutron’s MsgSubmitTx with the channel and ICA reference.

                                                                           3. When executed, Neutron sends that over IBC. On Osmosis side, it sees a valid ICA control packet and executes the swap as if the ICA account (owned by Neutron) submitted it. Any resulting state change (tokens, etc.) stays on Osmosis under that ICA account.

                                                                           4. You likely then query or transfer results back. For example, after a swap, you might IBC transfer the output tokens back to Neutron.

                                                                              * This is complex to implement manually – luckily the Neutron SDK provides high-level helpers. Expect Neutron docs with step-by-step ICA usage or even a higher-level abstraction (maybe future Neutron SDK could let you call a function like swap_on_osmosis(via_ICA, params) without manually crafting protobuf).

One limitation: the contract controlling an ICA must trust that the remote chain executed correctly. If something fails remotely, you get a failure ack. If it succeeds, fine. But debugging ICA can be tricky because you’re dealing with two chains and IBC latency. Emphasize testing ICA flows thoroughly on testnet with real connected chains.

                                                                              * Q: What happened to Neutron’s relationship with Cosmos Hub after Mercury?
 A: Post-Mercury, Neutron is independent, but the relationship is collaborative rather than hierarchical. Cosmos Hub is no longer Neutron’s security provider; however, they remain connected via IBC and shared goals. In fact, part of the Mercury proposal included an ATOM Economic Zone alignment: Neutron introduced an ATOM Reward Program to encourage ATOM holders to use Neutron DeFi and earmarked ~4.2M NTRN to incentivize ATOM-related use cases. So, while Neutron doesn’t pay the Hub validators anymore, it actively seeks to drive value to ATOM (and ATOM holders) in a mutualistic way. For developers, this means if your project involves ATOM (e.g., yield on ATOM, using ATOM as collateral), you might tap into these incentive programs. Also, Cosmos Hub is planning to launch its own consumer chain for smart contracts or allow CosmWasm on the Hub (as hinted by Mercury messaging), so Neutron might integrate or compete in some areas. But overall, Neutron will be marketed as a premier DeFi hub in close orbit of the Hub rather than a sub-hub.

In documentation or content, you’ll clarify: “Neutron was incubated with Cosmos Hub’s help and now stands on its own. They continue to collaborate via liquidity and incentives, but Neutron’s technical roadmap is self-determined.” This clarity helps developers and community understand that Neutron upgrades (like Mercury) are decided by Neutron’s governance, not Hub governance anymore.

Documentation Structure Recommendations
For cross-chain features, provide a mix of concept explanations and practical guides:
                                                                                 * Cross-Chain Concepts Overview: A doc page that introduces IBC in simple terms (diagrams could help – e.g., showing Neutron contract sending query to Hub and getting res (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)n ICS-20, ICA, ICQ conceptually with minimal code.

Also, instruct how to set u (Margined Protocol) (Margined Protocol)link to instructions for running the ICQ relayer (there’s a neutron-query-relayer repo【25†L123-L129 (Margined Protocol)erchain Accounts Example” – perhaps a tutorial where a Neutron contract manages to stake tokens on another chain. If too advanced, at least a guide on how to register an ICA and send a dummy tx (like a bank send on remote chain). Could be done via CLI if not via contract, to demonstrate.

                                                                                    * “Cross-Chain Token Transfers” – a user-facing how-to covering bridging assets to/from Neutron. Not just ICS-20 but mention Ethereum to Neutron via Axelar, etc. This might not be in developer docs but rather in a user guide section, however DevRel often covers it since dApp devs need to help their users with it.

                                                                                          * Neutron’s custom CosmWasm messages like neutron::interchain_txs::MsgSubmitTx and queries like neutron::interchain_queries::QueryResult etc. Provide schemas and explanation of fields (some of this is in Neutron SDK docs).

                                                                                          * CLI references for interchain operations (for devops).

                                                                                          * Config info: e.g., default IBC channels to major chains (Neutron docs might list known channels to Hub, Osmosis, etc., which devs can use instead of constantly looking them up).

                                                                                             * Best Practices: Perhaps a page on “Design Patterns for Cross-Chain dApps”. For instance, advise using timeouts on IBC transactions (so if something hangs, it doesn’t lock your logic forever), how to handle partial failures, and reminding that cross-chain calls incur delays (so design UX accordingly). Also mention security – e.g., if querying an external chain’s data, consider the trust (if chain is small, data could be spoofed by its 67% attack).

                                                                                             * Diagrams and Analogies: Since cross-chain is conceptually tough, use visuals. A sequence diagram of an Interchain Query lifecycle or an Interchain Account execution can greatly aid understanding. Perhaps embed those if available. Mercury governance threads or forum posts might have diagrams; you can repurpose them in docs (or create new ones).

                                                                                             * Keep terminology clear: Use consistent naming in docs for ICQ/ICA. Possibly create a glossary. For instance, define “Remote Zone” (target chain), “Controller contract” (Neutron contract using ICA), etc., to avoid confusion.

In separating tutorial vs reference, ensure that someone can fo (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog)al to actually implement a cross-chain feature end-to-end, then fall back on the reference for details. Also update any legacy references: the current docs might still mention Neutron as a consumer chain – update those sections to note the new security model (and remove references to fee split (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)).

Module 4: Developer Integration Patterns (Wallets, Ethereum Signatures, Privy, Skip)
Technical Overview
Neutron is not only innovating in the backend, but also in frontend integration and user onboarding. This module covers how developers can integrate Neutron into applications in a way that lowers friction for end-users – a critical aspect of DevRel. Key features/initiatives include:
                                                                                                   * Ethereum Signature Verification on Neutron

                                                                                                   * Privy integration (embedded wallets via email/social)

                                                                                                   * Skip “Go Fast” integration (speedy funding & transaction finalization)

                                                                                                   * Gas Abstraction and multi-coin gas payments (closely related to easing onboarding)

Ethereum Signature Verification: Neutron has implemented support for Ethereum-style cryptographic signatures for account key management. In practice, this means a user can use their existing Ethereum private key (e.g. in MetaMask) to sign transactions or messages for Neutron. Normally, Cosmos uses its own address format and signing (secp256k1 keys with SHA-256 hashing), whereas Ethereum uses secp256k1 with Keccak-256 and EIP-191/EIP-712 signing formats. Neutron bridges this gap. Concretely, Neutron likely supports an account type (perhaps using Ethermint’s technology) where an Ethereum ECDSA signature can be recognized by the (Spaydh on X: "Neutron's North Star" / X) transaction authentication. This would allow MetaMask to serve (with some tweaks) as a wallet for Neutron transactions. More immediately accessible is the ability for web dApps to let users log in with MetaMask: a dApp can ask the user to sign an Ethereum message proving ownership of an address, then the dApp can derive a corresponding Cosmos (Neutron) address and create a Neutron account for them (maybe by issuing a transaction that includes the pubkey recovered from that signature). The exact flow might involve a custom message type or a module on Neutron that verifies an EVM signature and associates it with a new account. The result: Users don’t need to create a new mnemonic or Keplr wallet if they come from Ethereum – they can use their familiar wallet. For developers, this simplifies onboarding of the vast Ethereum userbase: you can implement “Connect MetaMask” on your Neutron dApp and handle interactions similarly to an EVM chain. Note, though: since MetaMask isn’t natively aware of Neutron (which is not an EVM chain), developers might use libraries or backend services to convert a MetaMask signature into a Cosmos transaction. There is work on WalletConnect v2 supporting Cosmos, and possibly MetaMask Snaps or Leap Cosmos (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)t MetaMask can integrate with. Neutron’s support lays the groundwork; we need to wrap it in developer-friendly to (Spaydh on X: "Neutron's North Star" / X)ivy Integration:** Privy is a service that provides embedded, non-custodial wallets with easy login options (email, OAuth, etc.). Neutron’s mention of “ecosystem-wide Privy integration” suggests that Neutron dApps can use Privy so users can simply sign up with an email (for example) and immediately get a Neutron-compatible wallet created behind the scenes. Privy uses techniques like secure multi-party computation or key splitting (Shamir’s Secret Sharing) to manage keys so that neither the server nor the user alone has full control – thereby staying non-custodial but user-friendly. For DevRel, this means encouraging projects to integrate Privy’s SDK in their frontends: instead of forcing a user to install Keplr or MetaMask, the dApp can show a “Login with Email” button. Once authenticated, Privy provides the dApp a wallet object that can sign Neutron transactions on the user’s behalf, stored in the user’s device (with backup via email, etc.). This significantly reduces friction for Web2 users. It’s analogous to how some dApps on Solana use Magic.link or how web3 games use embedded wallets to abstract away seed phrases. On Neutron, Privy can co-exist with traditional wallets – it’s an option for those who want convenience.
From a technical perspective, integrating Privy requires front-end work (including Privy’s JS SDK), but minimal on-chain changes (the chain is agnostic to how keys are managed as long as valid signatures come through). Neutron’s role was likely coordinating with Privy to ensure compatibility and maybe sponsor its use in ecosystem apps. A developer will need to get an API key from Privy an (neutron-org/contracts2ts: Compile cosmwasm project into set ts client)ir integration guide (embedding a script, handling user login, then using Privy’s wallet to sign tx). Privy’s docs indicate support for multiple chains; Neutron likely is one of their supported chains if they announced integration.
Skip “Go Fast”: Skip is known in Cosmos for MEV services (they run auctions to capture MEV for validators). The Skip Go Fast product is an interoperability and UX improvement tool. Mercury highlights that with Skip’s integration, one can “create and fund a Neutron account in under 30 seconds”. Historically, bridging from Ethereum to a Cosmos chain (say via Axelar or Gravity) could take 10–30 minutes (for finality, relays, etc.). Skip Go Fast likely uses a combination of fast finality bridges + market makers to shorten this. For example, if a user wants to fund their Neutron account with USDC from Ethereum, Skip might: have liquidity on Neutron (USDC already available), and as soon as the user initiates a transfer on Ethereum, Skip front-runs the process by depositing USDC on Neutron to the user’s address (or gives them credit), expecting to receive the user’s bridged USDC when it arrives later. Essentially, Skip “advances” the funds to the user on Neutron. This way the user isn’t waiting 30 minutes – they get funds in 30 seconds or less. This is likely done via an API integration: a dApp or wallet cal (Token Factory - Overview | Neutron Docs)I with the user’s intent, and Skip orchestrates the cross-chain swap/transfer behind the scenes.
Additionally, Skip provides MEV protection and high-priority ordering. “Skip Go Fast” might also ensure the user’s account creation and funding TX gets included quickly and not stuck in mempools. Skip integrates at the mempool/consensus level on Neutron to allow certain transactions (especially those from their API) to be bundled and executed faster (possibly in the next block, bypassing any congestion). For developers, integrating Skip’s API can simplify bridging UX: you can offer a single-step onboarding where user picks their origin chain (Ethereum, Solana, etc.), enters amount, and Skip will handle swapping into a Neutron-compatible token and sending it to Neutro (Token Factory - Overview | Neutron Docs)r UI just reports progress via Skip’s status endpoints. Essentially, it’s “abstracting bridges and swaps into one API call.” Skip’s docs confirm multi-hop routes (e.g., use Circle’s USDC portal (CCTP) then IBC) and solving common issues like users arriving without gas – Skip can even ensure the user gets some NTRN or ATOM for gas on arrival (so they aren’t stranded with tokens and no gas).
Gas Abstraction & Multi-Denom Fees: Neutron now allows users to pay transaction fees in any liquid token on the network, not just NTRN. And it offers a 30% fee discount when using NTRN or ATOM for fees. This is a big UX win – users don’t have to acquire a new token just to pay gas. For devs, this means less onboarding pain: for instance, if your user only has ATOM, they can use ATOM to pay fees on Neutron directly. Under the hood, Neutron’s modules convert those fees (likely via the built-in DEX or oracle to value-match). The chain likely sets a conversion rate so that, say, if a user pays 1 ATOM as fee and NTRN is the base, it knows how to credit the validators appropriately. The 30% discount means if fee is 0.1 NTRN, paying in NTRN or ATOM costs you effectively 0.07 NTRN worth – a perk to encourage holding those tokens. As a developer, you might want to surface this in your UI (e.g., show fee options and note discount). Or if you’re building a wallet integration, ensure your fee selection logic can handle multiple denominations. For instance, a Neutron transaction has a fee field that could list amount: 1000000 [ibc/ATOM] instead of NTRN. This multi-fee feature likely uses Cosmos SDK’s x/feegrant or a custom module that was configured via governance.
Combined Flow Example: Suppose a new user visits a Neutron DeFi app. They have only MetaMask with some ETH and USDC, and an email. The ideal UX (enabled by these features) could be:
                                                                                                      1. User logs in with email -> a Privy wallet is silently created with a Neutron address.

                                                                                                      2. User connects MetaMask -> the app reads their Ethereum address, uses an Ethereum signature to link it to their Neutron address (perhaps storing a mapping or just for trust).

                                                                                                      3. The user says “I want to start with $100”. The app uses Skip’s API to initiate a transfer: Ethereum USDC -> Neutron USDC. Skip quickly credits Neutron USDC to the user’s new address.

                                                                                                      4. The user’s Neutron address now has USDC and even a bit of NTRN for gas (courtesy of Skip or the app could sponsor gas). They can immediately start using the dApp, and if they make a transaction, the app can choose USDC as the fee token if they have no NTRN. Or if they got some ATOM via an airdrop, they could use that with a fee discount.

All of this happens in a minute without the user managing a new wallet or token – a huge UX improvement. Neutron’s north star includes “streamlined funding flows” and “wallet abstraction” exactly like this.
Developer Analogy
Think of these integration features as “reducing the distance” between Web2 and Web3, and between Ethereum and Cosmos. For instance:
                                                                                                         * Ethereum signatures on Neutron: It’s like allowing a user to use the same key for a new door. If Ethereum is their house key, Neutron just made a lock that that key can open. So they don’t need a new key (wallet) to get in. For devs, it means you can welcome users with “login with MetaMask” just as many DApps do “login with Google”.

                                                                                                         * Privy’s embedded wallets: This is analogous to “single sign-on for crypto”. Just like websites let you sign up with email and handle all the account stuff behind scenes, Privy lets your user sign up with email and handles crypto keys under the hood. It’s non-custodial (the user still holds a part of the key, likely via their email auth), but it feels like a normal app login. So as a dev, you can tell users “No need to understand wallets, just sign in normally”. It’s training wheels for new crypto users, and they can always export their key later if they become power users.

                                                                                                         * Skip Go Fast: It’s like having an express lane or FastPass at a theme park. Normally, you’d wait in the bridging line for 30 minutes; Skip gives you a fast track so you’re on the ride (Neutron) in seconds. For devs, Skip abstracts multiple steps (swapping, bridging, waiting f (Spaydh on X: "Neutron's North Star" / X)y) into a simple service. It’s like using a payment gateway instead of expecting users to do a bank transfer manually – it automates and speeds the money flow.

                                                                                                         * Gas in any token: This can be likened to a car that can run on gasoline, diesel, or electric – whatever you have, it’ll use. Traditional blockchains are like gas cars (you must have that specific fuel). Neutron’s flexibility means users can pay fees with whatever token they hold, removing a step of conversion. The discount is like giving a loyalty reward for using the chain’s native currency or the ecosystem’s main coin (ATOM).

Key Developer Q&A
                                                                                                            * Q: How can my Neutron dApp support MetaMask login or Ethereum key users?
 A: There are a couple of approaches:

                                                                                                               * Signature-based account creation: Neutron supports verifying EVM signatures. Likely, if a user signs a message containing their intended Neutron address or public key with MetaMask, your backend or webapp can include that signature in a Neutron transaction (perhaps a custom MsgCreateEthAccount or something similar) that instructs Neutron to create an account tied to the Ethereum pubkey. Once that transaction is accepted, the user’s Ethereum key can directly sign future Neutron tx (with some adjustments, as MetaMask doesn’t natively compose Cosmos tx). Another approach used in some ecosystems is to use an Ethereum address as a Cosmos address (e.g., Evmos did this by using the same 20-byte address format). If Neutron adopted that, the user’s Neutron address could literally be 0xABC (Ethereum format) corresponding to their key. Then you just need a way to broadcast their Ethereum-signed tx to Neutron (maybe via RPC).

                                                                                                               * Wallet adapters: Projects like Leap or Keplr might provide a MetaMask compatibility layer. For example, Chainapsis (Keplr team) was working on Snap integration – a MetaMask Snap that adds Cosmos support. If such Snap exists for Neutron, a user could add it to MetaMask and then MetaMask can sign Cosmos tx through its interface. As a dev, you’d then integrate via WalletConnect or directly prompt MetaMask once Snap is installed.

                                                                                                                  * While this is evolving, the straightforward method now is to use WalletConnect v2 which supports Cosmos. MetaMask mobile supports WalletConnect, so a user could connect MetaMask to a Neutron dApp via WC, and then sign cosmos-formatted transactions if the dApp and wallet both understand the cosmos_signDirect or cosmos_signAmino calls. Some wallet providers (e.g., Leap) allow you to connect with an Ethereum wallet as a keystore but sign cosmos tx. This space is moving, so keep an eye on Neutron’s announcements for specific libraries. In docs, once a clear path is available (e.g., a specific MetaMask Snap or an open-source “eth-to-cosmos signer” library), provide a tutorial for it.

In the interim, a practical approach: If using Privy or a similar solution, you can let user login with MetaMask just to prove identity, then behind scenes create a Privy wallet for them on Neutron. So they used MetaMask just as an identity check (no funds moved), and then operate with a normal cosmos wallet. This hybrid approach might be easier short-term.

                                                                                                                  * Q: How do I integrate Privy into my application?
 A: Privy provides documentation (and presumably Neutron’s docs will have a section) on integrating their SDK. In summary:

                                                                                                                     * Sign up on Privy (get API keys).

                                                                                                                     * Include Privy’s JavaScript bundle in your app.

                                                                                                                     * Use Privy’s API to trigger login (you can choose login with email, Google, etc., depending on config).

                                                                                                                     * Once logged in, Privy yields a wallet object (for example, provider or signer that conforms to some standard). Under the hood, Privy manages the key (part in user’s device, part on their infra).

                                                                                                                     * Use that signer to sign Cosmos transactions or messages. Possibly Privy integrates with CosmJS or has its own TX building methods. If not, you could extract the private key (if Privy allows) or use their provided signing function. Likely, Privy handles transaction signing if you feed it the unsigned TX.

                                                                                                                     * Then broadcast the signed transaction to Neutron via RPC (Rest or gRPC). You might use Neutron’s RPC endpoint or a service like Blaze or Figment if they provide Neutron RPC.

                                                                                                                        * Privy essentially replaces something like Keplr extension. From a dev viewpoint, it’s like using any Web3 provider – you call methods to sign tx. The advantage is you don’t ask the user to install anything or manage keys. The potential downside is some users might eventually want full self-custody (so you should allow exporting keys or connecting a normal wallet later).

Neutron’s docs should include a guide for Privy setup specifically: including the chain ID, how to configure Privy for a Cosmos chain (Privy’s docs show they support Cosmos via key splitting). If any specific chain parameters (like slip-44 coin type or bech32 prefix) need to be set, those should be clearly listed.

Also, consider alternatives: There are other wallet-as-a-service providers (Web3Auth, Magic.link). Neutron chose Privy, but conceptually they do similar things. So while the focus is Privy, know that the architecture is not exclusive; devs could opt for another if they prefer, but they might not get the “ecosystem-wide” support Neutron is investing in.

                                                                                                                        * Q: What is Skip “Go Fast” and how do I use it in my dApp?
 A: Skip “Go Fast” is essentially an API for cross-chain transactions and expedited onboarding. As a developer, you typically interact with it through either:

                                                                                                                           * REST API calls: You send a request to Skip’s API specifying source chain, destination (Neutron), asset, amount, and user info (addresses, etc.). Skip will respond with either a transaction to sign on the source chain (like an Ethereum txn to approve & send USDC to Axelar) or if they have a widget, it could pop up a flow.

                                                                                                                           * Skip Widget: Skip may offer an embeddable widget where users can choose what to transfer and it handles the rest (similar to how you embed a Stripe payment form). The snippet from their docs suggests multiple integration approaches, including a widget.

                                                                                                                           * Client library: They have a TS library to simplify calls. You can use that instead of raw REST so you don’t have to manually craft requests or handle polling.

                                                                                                                              * For example, to let a user fund their Neutron account from Ethereum, you’d call Skip’s API to get a “route” for Ethereum->Neutron USDC. The API might return: first do Circle’s CCTP from ETH to Axelar USDC, then IBC to Neutron. Skip handles orchestrating those steps once the user signs the initial approval and transfer on Ethereum. They will ensure by the time it’s done, Neutron has the USDC in the user’s address. They also often include a gas drop: e.g., convert a tiny bit to NTRN or include some in the packet so user isn’t stuck without gas.

In the app, you’d show a progress bar or messages from Skip’s status endpoints (they provide tracking of each hop). The user experience is much smoother than juggling multiple wallets and waiting long periods.

To integrate:

                                                                                                                                 * Get an API key from Skip (join their Discord as they said).

                                                                                                                                 * Include their TS SDK or use their docs to hit the endpoints.

                                                                                                                                 * Test with small amounts on testnets if possible (Skip likely supports testnet flows too).

                                                                                                                                 * Provide fallback or info for users: e.g., if Skip isn’t available in some region or they prefer manual bridging, offer an alternate path.

                                                                                                                                    * Also highlight that Skip’s solution solves the “no gas on arrival” problem: If a user bridges tokens in normally, they often forget to also get the chain’s gas token. Skip can automatically include a little gas for them or do a swap on arrival. This is huge – your support team will get far fewer “I’m stuck, can’t move my tokens” tickets.

                                                                                                                                    * Q: How do multi-denom fees and gas abstraction work in practice? Do I need to implement anything to support it?
 A: On the chain side, Neutron has enabled a module where it accepts certain tokens as fees. As a developer, if you’re building a wallet or integrating transaction signing:

                                                                                                                                       * You should allow fee denomination to be variable. For example, when constructing a Cosmos SDK StdFee or Fee object, normally you’d put [ {amount: X, denom: "untrn"} ]. On Neutron, you might put denom "untrn" (NTRN) or "uatom" (ATOM) or even "uusdc" (if USDC is whitelisted) etc. The chain will reject fees in tokens that aren’t whitelisted or have no price info. Mercury specifically mentions any token “liquid on the network” – likely meaning any IBC asset with sufficient liquidity/price feed can be used. They specifically mention NTRN and ATOM (with discount), and in future perhaps others like USDC.

                                                                                                                                       * The conversion rate likely comes from the Oracle for those tokens (so if ATOM price is known in NTRN, the protocol can decide how much ATOM is needed for, say, 0.01$ worth of fee).

                                                                                                                                       * For devs: you may want to present to users a choice of fee token. For example, if user has NTRN and ATOM in wallet, maybe default to NTRN because of discount. If they have no NTRN, default to ATOM since that also has discount and they likely have ATOM (common). Or even allow USDC if they only have stablecoins.

                                                                                                                                       * If you’re just building contracts, you don’t directly deal with fees (that’s at transaction level). But if your contract expects users to call it, you could in your UI or documentation tell them “you can pay gas in any major token on Neutron”.

                                                                                                                                          * A key thing to document in Neutron docs is which tokens are accepted as gas and their conversion policy. This might be in a “Economics” or “Protocol Params” section. Also note that the 30% discount means if the chain’s minimum gas price is, say, 0.025 USD in value, paying in NTRN/ATOM effectively only requires 0.0175 USD worth of those tokens. It incentivizes using those for fees. This doesn’t require developer action, but it’s nice to highlight to power users (maybe wallets can show “Using ATOM saves you 30% on fees”).

Gas abstraction could also refer to future features like dApps sponsoring gas or users paying gas with credit card (some chains do meta-transactions). Right now, Neutron’s form is multi-coin gas. As DevRel, you might explore meta-tx in future (e.g., could your dApp pay the gas for users by using a relayer? Possibly, since you could accept USDC from user and then submit their tx with your own NTRN). Mercury doesn’t explicitly mention meta transactions beyond paying in any token, but skip’s mention of preventing “no gas” issues might be partially meta-tx (they could have a relayer submit first tx and deduct in the swap).

                                                                                                                                          * Q: Are there any libraries or SDKs that simplify these integrations (MetaMask, Privy, Skip)?
 A: Yes, several:

                                                                                                                                             * cosmos-kit / WalletConnect: For wallet integrations (Keplr, Leap, etc.), @cosmos-kit/core is a React-friendly library that handles connecting to various wallets. It might not natively cover MetaMask-eth-keys, but as cosmos and eth converge (with WC v2), cosmos-kit may add support. Keep an eye on their updates.

                                                                                                                                             * Privy SDK: Privy has its own SDK. Possibly Neutron or Skip might fork a simple demo integrating Privy + Skip.

                                                                                                                                             * Skip TS SDK: as mentioned, use Skip’s client library to avoid manual REST calls.

                                                                                                                                             * Neutron.js / cosmjs: The Neutron team has neutronjs repo (TypeScript c (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)ight already incorporate multi-denom fee logic and custom message types. Using their prepared client ensures you don’t have to manually craft protos for ICQ for example. Also, CosmJS (the generic Cosmos TS library) can be extended with Neutron’s proto definitions – maybe Neutron provides an extension package.

                                                                                                                                             * Ethermint libraries: If interacting with Ethereu (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)Ethermint project (which powers Evmos) has code for EIP-712 signing of Cosmos tx. There might be a JS library from Evmos that you can use or adapt to get MetaMask to sign a Neutron tx. For instance, @tharsis/ethers-react (Evmos library) lets you sign cosmos tx with Metamask by encoding them as an Ethereum signable message. These could be directly applicable to Neutron with minor tweaks (chain ID difference).

                                                                                                                                                * Always check Neutron’s official dev resources; they might have combined some of these into templates or example projects (like a reference dApp that uses Privy + MetaMask).

Documentation Structure Recommendations
Focusing on making it easy for devs to implement thes (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)tion Guides:** Separate guides for each major integration:
                                                                                                                                                   * “Using MetaMask with Neutron” – Explain how Ethereum keys are supported. Provide a step-by-step of one method (e.g., using an Evmos library or WalletConnect approach). If MetaMask Snap is available, document how to install it and use it. This guide could show how to derive the Cosmos address fr (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum) pubkey (so devs understand what's happening under the hood).

                                                                                                                                                   * “Embedded Wallets via Privy” – A tutorial showing how to sign up for Privy, integrate the login, and send a sample transaction on Neutron (maybe a simple bank send) using the Privy wallet. It should also cover how to get the Neutron address of the logged-in user (so the dApp can display it).

                                                                                                                                                   * “Fast Bridging with Skip” – Provide code snippets using Skip’s API or widget. If possible, a minimal example where a user moves some tokens from one chain to Neutron. Document how to obtain API keys and any testnet endpoints for Skip. Also emphasize safety: maybe suggest to always provide a manual alternative if Skip fails (just in case).

                                                                                                                                                   * “Gas and Fees on Neutron” – Document multi-denom fees. This could be in a “Network” or “Protocol” section rather than a how-to, but it’s worth explaining to wallet devs how to get conversion rates (likely from oracle module via query) if they need to compute fee in alternate denom. Possibly provide a formula or point to where the conversion logic is (maybe it’s simply: chain expects fees in X such that (fee_amount * price_X) ≥ (min_gas_price * gas_used) * 0.7 if X is NTRN/ATOM).

                                                                                                                                                   * Also mention the default gas price or how to estimate gas. Many Cosmos devs use a fixed gas price, but if user pays in different denom, need the conversion. Likely easier is to let the chain calculate required minimal fee (some chains do that).

                                                                                                                                                   * Reference/Explanations:

                                                                                                                                                      * A section for “Accounts” explaining Ethereum vs Cosmos keys, and how Neutron accounts are structured post-Mercury (just NTRN staking accounts, etc.).

                                                                                                                                                      * Privy and Skip might have their own documentation – link out to them but also summarize key points in Neutron docs to keep context.

                                                                                                                                                      * If any configuration is needed on-chain: e.g., an allowlist of fee tokens or Privy chain config – mention those, maybe in an appendix.

                                                                                                                                                         * UX Best Practices: Provide guidance gleaned from North Star UX goals:

                                                                                                                                                            * Suggest to devs: if targeting mainstream users, consider offering email login (Privy) and MetaMask as options, hide seed phrases entirely.

                                                                                                                                                            * Encourage using gas abstraction: e.g., if user has only USDC, perhaps your app can automatically swap a tiny amount to NTRN for them (though with Neutron they might not need to if USDC is accepted for fees).

                                                                                                                                                            * Emphasize security: even though Privy is easier, advanced users might want to migrate to Keplr/ledger – advise devs to allow exporting keys or connecting those wallets too for those who want it.

                                                                                                                                                            * Provide analogies as in this guide to justify why these integrations matter (makes it easier for product managers to see the value).

Module 5: Supervaults Architecture and Capital Efficiency
Technical Overview
Supervaults are one of Neutron’s headline DeFi innovations introduced around the Mercury upgrade. They represent a novel design for liquidity provisioning and yield generation that leverages Neutron’s integrated infrastructure (Oracle, Cron, Duality DEX) to achieve maximal capital efficiency and improve trader outcomes. Let’s unpack what a Supervault is from a technical standpoint:
At its core, a Supervault is a smart contract (or set of contracts) that manages liquidity on behalf of users across one or more venues, with an advanced strategy. Traditional yield vaults (like Yearn vaults or compounders) take user deposits and automatically invest/reinvest them to earn yield. A Supervault goes further by actively providing liquidity in the most efficient way possible, minimizing slippage for trades and maximizing fees for LPs.
Specifically on Neutron, Supervaults are closely tied to the Duality DEX module:
                                                                                                                                                                        * Duality allows many types of liquidity positions (AMM curves, limit (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)n one orderbook-AMM hybrid).

                                                                                                                                                                        * A Supervault likely deploys liquidity into Duality in a dynamic fashion, adjusting positions as market conditions change. For example, instead of a passive AMM that provides liquidity across a wide price range (incurring impermanent loss and offering less depth at current price), a Supervault could concentrate liquidity around the current market price s (Mercury: Accelerating Integrated Finance with Neutron’s Sovereign L1 | by Neutron.org | Mar, 2025 | Cosmos Ecosystem Blog) v3, and update that range continuously as the price moves.

                                                                                                                                                                        * How does it update continuously? This is where Neutron’s Oracle and Cron come in. The vault contract can read the latest price from the Oracle each block and, say, if the price has moved enough, use Cron to trigger a rebalance: withdrawing liquidity from outdated ranges and adding to new ranges around the new price. This ensures at any time, most liquidity is placed where trades are happening, resulting in large trades with minimal slippage. This was explicitly mentioned: Supervaults enable large trades with minimal slippage by leveraging built-in oracle and Cron.

                                                                                                                                                                        * Meanwhile, liquidity providers in the Supervault benefit because their liquidity is always optimally placed (earning fees more consistently and not sitting idle off-range). This makes liquidity provisioning lucrative – more so than passive LPing – potentially attracting more TVL.

Another aspect is integrating multiple yield streams:
                                                                                                                                                                           * The term “Supervault” implies it might combine strategies. For instance, a vault could not only earn trading fees, but also take the LP tokens and stake them (if there’s a gauge or incentive), or use a portion to farm elsewhere. Mercury’s notes mention new ways to earn like Droplets and Ingots for liquid stakers – it sounds like there are reward tokens in play (maybe Droplets for providing liquidity, Ingots for something else).

                                                                                                                                                                           * It's possible Supervaults tie into Neutron's liquid staking (dNTRN) and other protocols like Drop (a yield protocol). For example, a Supervault might accept NTRN, stake it to get dNTRN (earning staking yield), then use the dNTRN in liquidity provisioning at the same time (so it layers staking yield + trading fees).

                                                                                                                                                                           * This would be akin to superfluid staking on Osmosis, but generalized: one asset can be used simultaneously in multiple ways. Neutron’s integrated design (all in one chain) and high throughput enable such combinations.

From an architecture perspective, a Supervault might consist of:
                                                                                                                                                                              * A Vault contract where users deposit asset X (and maybe Y for a pair).

                                                                                                                                                                              * The vault issues a share token representing their stake (like vault LP token).

                                                                                                                                                                              * Under the hood, the contract interfaces with Duality’s module to place orders or liquidity. It uses Oracle data for decision-making each block (or each Cron tick).

                                                                                                                                                                              * It might also interface with other modules: e.g., use an Interchain Account to deploy some capital on another chain if needed for yield (less likely for initial version, probably stays on Neutron).

                                                                                                                                                                              * The strategies (like how to rebalance) could be coded or configurable. Possibly governed by Neutron DAO or vault creators.

Capital Efficiency Gains: The main goal is that each dollar in a Supervault is utilized to the fullest:
                                                                                                                                                                                 * If idle, it’s staked earning yield.

                                                                                                                                                                                 * When providing liquidity, it’s positioned at the right price to facilitate big trades (improving execution quality for traders – one of Neutron’s North Star metrics).

                                                                                                                                                                                 * By minimizing slippage, traders get better prices, which attracts more volume, which in turn generates more fees for LPs – a positive feedback loop improving efficiency of markets on Neutron.

It’s helpful to compare with Concentrated Liquidity AMMs (Uniswap v3): Those require LPs to actively manage their price ranges or use third-party managers. Supervaults essentially automate concentrated liquidity management on-chain. Traditional concentrated LP requires off-chain or manual adjustments; here, Cron and Oracle do it trustlessly. This idea has been theorized (so-called “Active Liquidity” vaults), and Neutron appears to be implementing it as a native concept.
Another aspect is risk management: the Oracle ensures the vault responds quickly to price changes, but if price moves extremely fast, the vault could still suffer IL or not adjust in time (block times are short though, ~1.8s trending to 0.1s). The Cron jobs are per-block, so essentially continuous. The performance improvements of Mercury (11× gas) are crucial – recalculating and moving liquidity every block is computation-heavy, but now feasible with high gas limits.
Validator Economic Model tie-in: Mercury’s docs mention “Duality performance boost & risk reduction through auto-swap and behind-enemy-lines liquidity management”. This cryptic phrasing hints that beyond Supervaults, maybe validators or the protocol also manage liquidity to reduce risk (maybe arbitrage behind the scenes). But focusing on vaults: it's about automation.
To summarize technically: A Supervault on Neutron is a **composable yield aggr (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)
                                                                                                                                                                                    * Uses on-chain price oracle to always know the fair price.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Uses Cron to execute strategy adjustments every block or interval.

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Provides concentrated liquidity on Duality (likely via an AMM curve or order placements that follow the oracle price).

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Possibly stakes or leverages assets simultaneously (if applicable).

                                                                                                                                                                                    * Issues derivative tokens to depositors (which could themselves be used in other places, e.g., as collateral – which enhances capita (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)urther).

                                                                                                                                                                                    * By being integrated, it avoids reliance on external keepers or off-chain managers, making it more reliable and transparent (users can see exactly how the strategy works on-chain).

Developer Analogy
Consider a Supervault like an AI-driven market maker that works for you 24/7. In a traditional setting, providing liquidity is like parking your money on an exchange order book at various prices, hoping trades happen. If the market moves, your orders might become irrelevant (too far from current price) – that’s inefficient, like parking (Mercury: Towards the Integrated Endgame - Main DAO Proposals - Neutron Forum)k in a spot where no customers are. A Supervault is like a food truck with a smart navigation system that always drives to where the crowd is. It repositions itself (your liquidity) to where the demand is (current trading price). The built-in oracle is the GPS that tells it where the crowd (market price) is every minute, and Cron is the engine moving it quickly. So LPs always sell hotdogs where the line is longest, maximizing sales (fees), and customers always find a food truck when they want one (traders find deep liquidity at the current price).
Another analogy: It’s like autopilot for liquidity. You (LP) provide the capital, set it to autopilot, and the system handles the rest – adjusting and optimizing. This is something only a deeply integrated system could do reliably, which is why we don’t see it on every chain.
For capital efficiency: Traditional DeFi might have you split funds – some in staking, some in LP, some idle for opportunities. A Supervault tries to multi-task your capital. It's as if you had $100, and with it you could simultaneously earn staking rewards and provide liquidity and be used as collateral – effectively making that $100 work like $200. This aligns with the goal of maximizing exposure per unit capital. It's like multitasking for money – one dollar doing the work of many.
Key Developer Q&A
                                                                                                                                                                                       * Q: How do Supervaults differ from ordinary liquidity pools or yield vaults?
 A: Traditional liquidity pools (like on Uniswap or Osmosis) are passive – liquidity sits according to some curve (constant product, etc.) and LPs suffer from impermanent loss if price moves. They don’t adjust unless the LP manually intervenes. Standard yield vaults (Yearn) are active but typically move funds between lending markets or farms; they aren’t usually providing on-chain liquidity in an order book context. Supervaults combine these concepts: they actively manage liquidity in a trading venue. So compared to a normal pool, a Supervault:

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Moves liquidity dynamically to track the market price (like an active market maker).

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Aims to greatly reduce impermanent loss by always centering liquidity around the current price – so if price moves, the vault moves too, rather than leaving assets on the wrong side of the pool.

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Potentially can employ risk management strategies like auto-harvesting fees or hedging.

                                                                                                                                                                                          * Also, because it’s enshrined in Neutron, it can use privileged data (the chain’s oracle) and execution (Cron at end-block) that third-party vaults elsewhere might not have.

                                                                                                                                                                                             * For an end-user, a Supervault means they deposit asset(s) and get back a token, and the vault contract does the heavy lifting. They likely won’t have to micromanage ranges or strategies. The expectation is better returns (through higher fee earnings and possibly incentives) and possibly some IL mitigation (though IL can still occur if price trends in one direction – you can’t remove it entirely unless hedging).

From a dev perspective: If you’re building on Neutron, you might not need to create your own vault from scratch because the ecosystem’s providing these supervaults. Instead, you might integrate them: e.g., use Supervault tokens as collateral in your lending protocol, or recommend users deposit into a Supervault to manage liquidity for your token’s market.

                                                                                                                                                                                             * Q: What is the “technical case” for Supervaults – why are they possible on Neutron but not easily elsewhere?
 A: This is a great question to highlight Neutron’s unique selling points. The technical case is:

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Access to Oracle inside the chain: Off-chain or third-party vaults (like on Uniswap v3 on Ethereum) have to rely on external price feeds or observations, which have latency and trust issues. Neutron’s vaults get an authoritative price feed (like a TWAP or median price from validators) every block. This ensures they adjust liquidity to a trustworthy price, not a manipulated one, and they can do so extremely quickly (per block).

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Cron for guaranteed execution: On other chains, active strategies depend on bots (which might not trigger exactly when needed, or could fail during network congestion). Cron means if a rebalance condition is met, it will execute as part of block processing. So the strategy is reliable and can even have complex conditional logic executed on-chain without needing human intervention.

                                                                                                                                                                                                * High throughput and low latency: If you tried to do this on a slower chain, you might not keep up with price moves or handle many vault operations concurrently. Neutron’s 330M gas and soon sub-second blocks means even in a volatile market, the vault can adjust maybe 10 times a second if needed (practically probably not that much, but it’s capable). That’s basically real-time market making, on-chain.

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Integrated DEX (Duality): Because the DEX is part of the chain, the Supervault can interact with it efficiently – possibly even at a lower gas cost or with direct access that an external contract would struggle with. Also, Duality’s design (orderbook & AMM hybrid) likely provides the hooks needed to place specific kinds of liquidity orders. For instance, it might allow the vault to place a batch of limit orders around current price – effectively constructing a liquidity curve with more control than a typical AMM. That synergy means the vault’s strategy can be precisely executed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                * Unified environment: All the pieces (Oracle, Cron, DEX, vault logic) live in one atomic environment – Neutron’s chain. This eliminates cross-component latency and risk. If you attempted to do similar on Ethereum: you’d have Chainlink oracles (off-chain nodes, feeds slower), a separate AMM (Uniswap), and perhaps a controller contract that triggers via Keeper network – many moving parts and potential points of failure or lag. Neutron’s architecture unifies these as on-chain modules, which is a far cleaner and more robust design for something like Supervaults.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Summing up: Neutron is practically tailor-made to implement an automated market-making vault that wouldn’t break or lag in a fast market – that’s the “technical case”. It’s leveraging enshrined infra to do something novel in DeFi.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Q: How can developers interact with or extend Supervaults?
 A: If you are a developer building on Neutron, you might want to:

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Use Supervault tokens: When users deposit to a Supervault, they likely receive a vault share token (like an LP token). This token could be made composable – e.g., your lending protocol could accept it as collateral, recognizing it's a productive asset (earning fees in the vault). Or a governance protocol might accept it for voting (meaning even LPs can vote by using vault token as voting power, etc.). You’d treat it like any other token (CW20 or native denom if implemented that way).

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Build new strategies: Perhaps the initial Supervaults focus on a few pairs (like NTRN/ATOM or stable pairs). A developer could create new vaults for other asset pairs or with different strategy parameters (maybe one vault does very tight range for low volatility pair, another does wider ranges for volatile pairs). If Neutron’s code for Supervaults is open and modular, you might fork or extend it. Or if they provide a framework, you could plug in custom strategy logic (for example, if someone wanted to incorporate an off-chain signal or a different rebalancing heuristic).

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Integrate into UI: If you run a DEX UI or portfolio manager, you’ll want to display Supervault positions, yields, etc. This means reading vault contract state – like current total assets, value of share token, performance statistics. As a dev, you should use Neutron’s queries or indexer to get that info. Possibly Neutron will release an SDK or subgraph integration for vaults.

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Composability: Because vaults operate with other modules, devs should be aware of how they behave. For instance, if a user withdraws from a vault, the vault might need to remove some liquidity from Duality to free up assets – which might not be instant if mid-block. But since it can schedule it, it’s likely fine. Still, if your use-case needs instant liquidity vs slightly delayed, consider that.

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * The Drop protocol (mentioned in references) might be integrated. Drop could provide additional yield or risk management to vaults (Droplets/Ingots might be reward tokens or receipts). As a developer, you might consider those tokens or flows in your integration.

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * If Supervaults are governed by Neutron DAO parameters, devs can also participate in governance proposals to tweak them (like change how frequently to rebalance or how oracle prices are computed, etc., if those are adjustable).

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Q: Are Supervaults live and where can we see the code or audits?
 A: By Mercury (April 2025), the feature is introduced conceptually, but actual vaults might roll out with dApps like Astroport or others on Neutron. The Mercury text suggests it’s a new feature at launch, possibly developed by Neutron team or partners. There may have been testnet trials or audit reports (the Mercury proposal said audit reports will be released, presumably covering vault contracts among other things).

Encourage developers to look at:

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Neutron’s GitHub for any “vault” or “duality” related contracts.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * The Astroport team (since Astroport is mentioned as integrated on Neutron) might incorporate supervault concepts for their liquidity pools.

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Mars Protocol or Margined Protocol (mentioned in Neutron grants) building “Locust vault” strategy. Margined’s Locust is a market-making vault using Authz on Duality, sounding very much like a precursor to Supervault. That code could be in Margined’s GitHub.

                                                                                                                                                                                                               * So yes, Supervaults should either have code in open or be imminent. If not open yet, devs can follow updates or join testnets (pion-1 might have had a version).

Documentation Structure Recommendations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Concept Article: Have a doc page that explains Supervaults conceptually (much like above), with diagrams if possible. Show how a price move triggers vault actions, perhaps with a timeline diagram.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * User Guide: There should be a user-facing tutorial “How to use a Supervault” which DevRel might help craft, but for developer docs, focus on integration.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Developer Guide: If the vaults are programmable or extendable, document the contract interfaces. For example: what message to send to deposit or withdraw (if interacting programmatically), how the share token is implemented (CW20 with name “Supervault NTRN/ATOM LP”). Document any math formulas (like how share token value is calculated, fees etc.) for developers doing analytics.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Reference: Provide links to the repository or code for Supervaults. If it’s part of Duality module or a separate contract, indicate that. Possibly provide a simplified pseudo-code of the rebalancing algorithm for transparency.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Parameters: Document if there are parameters like interval of Cron (maybe every block or every X blocks), how far price must move to trigger reposition, etc. These details could be important if developers want to predict vault behavior or simulate it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Incorporation with other modules: e.g., mention that deposit/withdraw might use the Oracle too for valuations, etc.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Comparisons: Perhaps include a section comparing Supervault approach to others (Uni v3 positions, etc.) to give context.

Since Supervaults straddle the line between being a core protocol feature and a DeFi application, its docs might be both in Neutron’s official docs and in some blog posts or medium articles. For instance, Neutron or partners might release a blog showing how supervaults achieved X% less slippage. Link those resources for further reading.

There might be a dedicated article from Neutron or Duality teams explaining the mechanism in plainer language.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Duality documentation: Check if Duality (the DEX) has docs or code comments about “auto-swap” or “liquidity management behind enemy lines” (interesting term used). Possibly refers to using Cron to schedule swaps to rebalance inventory (like if vault has too much of one asset, auto-swap some to balance – which reduces risk).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Grants and community posts: The Margined Protocol grant describes vault strategies using Authz on Duality – that suggests they built an early version (with off-chain triggers via Authz). That hackmd link in their info might have design details. Devs can read that to get insight.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Informal Systems reports: They audited Duality and maybe the vaults. If those reports are public, they’ll contain detailed explanations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Mathematical reference: If curious, research “concentrated liquidity vault strategies” – some researchers have published on optimal liquidity provision. Neutron’s team likely studied those in designing supervault logic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Neutron Discord/Forums: There might be discussion or parameter tuning ongoing in community – a place to ask technical questions about vault inner workings.

Armed with this, a DevRel engineer can explain and advocate how Supervaults substantially improve capital efficiency on Neutron: e.g., “Our trade execution slippage is up to 90% lower than on AMMs without active liquidity – see how a $1M trade barely moves the price on Neutron’s NTRN/USDC market, thanks to Supervault-managed liquidity.” This narrative will attract sophisticated traders and LPs to the ecosystem.
Module 6: Asset Issuer Enablement (Yield-Bearing Assets & EVM Migration)
Technical Overview
Neutron positions itself as an ideal platform for issuing yield-bearing assets and for projects migrating from Ethereum (EVM) to Cosmos. This module focuses on how Neutron supports asset issuers (like stablecoin providers, liquid staking derivatives, or other interest-bearing tokens) with standard contracts and infrastructure, and how it eases the process for Ethereum-based projects to deploy in CosmWasm.
Yield-Bearing Assets: These are tokens that inherently accrue value or pay yield. Examples include:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs): tokens like stATOM, stOSMO, or in Neutron’s case, dNTRN (derivative NTRN) which represent staked NTRN + accumulated rewards.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Interest-bearing stablecoins: e.g., tokens that appreciate as they represent a claim on some lending interest (like Aave’s aTokens or Compound’s cTokens).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Structured products: e.g., vault tokens from Supervaults or other yield aggregators – these are also yield-bearing because their NAV increases from fees earned.

Neutron provides a fertile ground for these:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Standard CosmWasm contracts: issuing a token on Neutron is straightforward via a CW20 contract (CosmWasm’s fungible token standard, analogous to ERC-20). There are well-tested implementations (cw20-base, cw20-bonding, etc.). For yield-bearing behavior, one can either:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Increase the token’s value via redemption rate (like cTokens: 1 cToken increasingly represents more underlying over time).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Or periodically distribute more tokens to holders (like rebase tokens, e.g., Ampleforth or stETH does rebasing where balances grow).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * CosmWasm allows either approach. Many LSDs opt for a changing redemption rate (non-rebasing), which is simpler contract-wise (you track an index internally).

Neutron likely encourages LSD issuers to launch on Neutron by providing them template contracts or integration support. For example, the upcoming maxBTC was mentioned as a yield-bearing BTC asset (perhaps earning Bitcoin staking yields or CeDeFi yields). Such an issuer can create a token on Neutron, leveraging ICS-20 to get BTC representation (maybe via Nomic’s nBTC or via interchain queries to track BTC yield?), and then program the yield logic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Integrated yield sources: Neutron’s advantage is that once an asset is issued, it can easily be made productive in the ecosystem:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If someone issues a stablecoin on Neutron, they can quickly provide deep liquidity for it via Supervaults, or have it accepted as gas fee payment (if whitelisted), or have Oracle support for it (so other protocols can use it as collateral, etc.).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * For LSDs like dNTRN or others, Neutron can plug them into strategies (like maybe a dNTRN-ATOM vault, etc.). The chain’s design of focusing on capital efficiency means yield-bearing assets will find natural integration points (like being used in Multi-chain strategies).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Validator Economic tie-in: If an LSD like dNTRN is issued (likely by Neutron’s Drop protocol or Lido collaborators), Neutron’s oracle and Cron can help automate the LSD’s reward compounding and exchange rate updates. Also, Mercury’s base validator comp and no-slashing means LSD providers might not worry about complex slashing accounting at start (since slashing disabled temporarily, LSD logic simpler initially).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * maxBTC Example: maxBTC is cited as a future yield-bearing BTC on Neutron. Possibly, it could work by users depositing BTC (maybe via an IBC bridge like Nomic or via centralized custodian or via an Ethereum wrapped BTC then bridged). This BTC is then deployed to earn yield (maybe in Bitcoin mining derivatives or lending in CeFi or other chain). The yield is reflected in maxBTC’s value. On Neutron, one could implement maxBTC as a contract where:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Users mint maxBTC by depositing BTC (through some cross-chain interaction).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * The contract periodically updates the exchange rate or supplies rewards to maxBTC holders based on yield collected.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Integration: maxBTC can immediately be traded on Neutron (Duality), used as collateral in Mars (if Mars goes multi-chain to Neutron), etc. Neutron offering an easy environment for that means the issuer doesn’t have to launch a whole chain or rely on Ethereum’s congestion.

EVM Migration: Many DeFi projects are built in Solidity for EVM. To attract them, Neutron offers:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * CosmWasm, a robust smart contract platform: While not EVM, CosmWasm covers most DeFi use cases with added safety (Rust’s strong type system prevents many bugs, as noted earlier). Migrating requires rewriting in Rust, but the Cosmos ecosystem has a lot of template code for common things:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * CW20 instead of ERC20.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * CW20 collateral+vault contracts instead of certain solidity patterns.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * There are libraries analogous to OpenZeppelin (in cw-plus).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * CosmWasm now supports features like governance-controlled upgradability (via migrate), so projects can upgrade logic similarly to proxy patterns on Ethereum but in a safer way.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Neutron SDK and tooling: There’s a TypeScript codegen (contracts2ts) that can generate TS clients from Rust contracts, making dApp integration easier (similar to how Solidity’s ABI->Typechain works). So Ethereum devs who are used to writing a frontend with ethers.js can use CosmJS or Neutron’s TS client similarly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Documentation and Support: This study guide itself forms a basis of knowledge. Additionally, the Neutron core team or community might assist projects in rewriting logic. As DevRel, one might create mapping guides: e.g., “Solidity to CosmWasm: mapping of common patterns”.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Interoperability with Ethereum: If a project doesn’t want to rewrite, theoretically they could deploy on an EVM chain and connect to Neutron via IBC (like how DEX Osmosis connected to Ethereum via Axelar for assets, but logic stays on Eth – not ideal for latency). But migrating logic to Neutron means benefiting from Neutron’s environment directly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Some projects might choose to deploy on both EVM and Neutron. If so, they’ll want to keep state in sync or handle them separately. Neutron’s cross-chain capabilities might allow a Neutron contract to control or read an Ethereum contract (though IBC doesn’t natively talk to Ethereum, one would need bridging or oracles like Hyperlane). That’s complex; better to fully migrate or build native on Neutron for new stuff.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Token Factory: Note Neutron has a tokenfactory module (like Osmosis does). This allows native asset creation without a contract – basically creating a new denom under your address control. This is another path for issuers: use tokenfactory to mint a token (which is a native chain coin, not a contract coin). This can be great for simple fixed-supply tokens or those fully controlled by issuer. For yield-bearing, a contract is more flexible. But a combination is possible: e.g., an issuer uses tokenfactory to create “IST” stablecoin denom and then uses a CosmWasm contract to manage its issuance (with the contract being the only one allowed to mint/burn via tokenfactory). This might save gas per transfer (native denoms are efficient) and integrate at chain level (like easier whitelisting for fees, etc.). Neutron docs mention tokenfactory exists, so yes, it’s an option to mention to issuers.

Standard Contracts & Modules:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Neutron can provide out-of-the-box contract templates for common use cases: e.g., a stablecoin that maintains peg via a collateralized debt position (CDP) system – perhaps adapting code from Kujira’s USK or Terra’s vaults.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Or a bonding module (similar to OlympusDAO bonds, etc.) if needed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Possibly integration with ICS-20: If an issuer’s asset originates elsewhere, ICS-20 can carry it in. For example, if someone already has an ERC20 on Ethereum, they might not want to reissue on Neutron – they could bridge it in and then issue a yield version on Neutron that wraps it.

Neutron’s ethos is to be chain-agnostic in connecting assets, but chain-specific in providing superior execution. So, asset issuers can bring assets from any chain and leverage Neutron’s DeFi capabilities to add yield or utility.
Developer Analogy
Issuing an asset on Neutron vs on a standalone chain is like launching a new app in an app store vs building a whole operating system for it. If you launch a token on your own new chain, you have to bootstrap a validator set, connectivity, liquidity from scratch – akin to writing a new OS and convincing users to install it. On Neutron, you deploy it as one more app on an already bustling platform: security is handled, cross-chain connectivity is immediate (via IBC), and you plug into existing “app store services” – in this case, Neutron’s oracles, DEX, vaults, etc., which give your asset utility from day one.
For an Ethereum project, moving to Neutron is like a tech company moving from a very congested city (Ethereum with high gas and competition) to a special economic zone with high-speed infrastructure and direct highways to other hubs (Cosmos IBC connectivity). There’s an adjustment (learn new language = Rust, new laws = Cosmos SDK), but once settled, you enjoy lower costs (fees) and more synergy with other services around (like built-in oracle instead of paying Chainlink, built-in scheduler instead of running keepers, etc.).
And importantly, you still can serve your old customers – because IBC and Skip allow Ethereum users to come to Neutron easily (as discussed in Module 4), you’re not cutting off that user base; you’re extending it with a better experience.
Key Developer Q&A
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Q: I want to launch a yield-bearing token (say a liquid staking token) on Neutron. What tools does Neutron offer to make this easier?
 A: Neutron offers:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Existing contract frameworks: You don’t have to code from scratch. For a liquid staking token, you could use the well-known Lido Cosmos contracts (if open-sourced) as a baseline. Lido had stATOM on Neutron’s testnets possibly, and Stride’s code is also public. CosmWasm code for LSD typically has an exchange rate state, a deposit function that stakes underlying and mints derivative, a redeem that unstakes underlying (with unbonding wait) and burns derivative. Neutron’s interchain accounts can help here (your contract can use an ICA to delegate to validators trustlessly).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Interchain queries to easily get validator info (like total stake, rewards) from the Hub or Neutron’s own staking module if needed, to calculate yields.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Cron to automate reward compounding: e.g., auto-reinvest staking rewards every X blocks to continuously grow the LSD value (so users don’t have to manually claim).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Oracle to, if needed, report price of LSD vs underlying or vs USD for other uses (the Oracle will naturally have NTRN price which LSD might follow with a factor).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Token Factory if you prefer native denom: you could create a native token representing the LSD. But likely a CW20 is fine and more flexible with contract logic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Additionally, the Drop protocol on Neutron is specifically geared for yield-bearing tokens (Drop might be a yield aggregator that handles LSD distribution – we saw mention of “Droplets” which could be rewards). The Neutron community or Interchain Foundation might provide grants or direct support for key asset issuers (like they want a good BTC, good stablecoin, etc.). For example, there’s explicit mention that Neutron wants to be the best place for yield-bearing token issuers with maxBTC as an example. So if you come with a plan to launch, you’ll find an enthusiastic ecosystem (perhaps incentives, liquidity support from Astroport, etc.).

In summary, Neutron has the on-chain automation and cross-chain control needed to seamlessly manage an asset that gets yield from elsewhere (like staking yield, or even off-chain yield if you integrate with oracles). And you get instant market access via the integrated DEX and potential listing in cross-chain aggregators.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Q: We have an Ethereum DeFi protocol (Solidity). How difficult is it to port to Neutron’s CosmWasm?
 A: Difficulty depends on complexity, but many patterns translate well:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * If your protocol is relatively straightforward (ERC20 token, lending pool, etc.), you’ll find direct equivalents in CosmWasm (CW20, cw20-based lending templates like from Mars or Cosmos’s lending apps).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * For more complex logic (like custom math, advanced vaults), you’ll need a Rust developer to rewrite the logic. The logic itself can often be similar structure. For example, a function that calculates interest in Solidity can be implemented in Rust fairly directly (just minding different numeric types, Rust’s overflow-checking vs Solidity’s unchecked).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * One challenge is that CosmWasm is single-threaded and deterministic – you cannot have parallel execution or random calls out. But that’s same as EVM determinism. Rust’s heavy computations might need careful gas metering (CosmWasm charges gas for CPU and memory).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Testing in Rust can actually be nicer, as you can write unit tests in pure Rust. But you also have to set up proper schema serialization (CosmWasm uses JSON Serde for query responses which is straightforward).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * There might be specific features to adapt:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * No global time now(): block time and height come from env, similar to block.timestamp in Ethereum.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * No direct access to other contracts except through messages: in Ethereum you might call another contract’s function directly, in CosmWasm you instead send an execute message to it. But if the other contract is known (like cw20 contract), there are standard interfaces and helper functions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Upgrades: In Ethereum you might use proxy contracts for upgradability, in CosmWasm you can use migrate which is a built-in mechanism allowing you to shift a contract’s code to a new version, preserving state, if you had that permission (often controlled by DAO governance). This is arguably safer and simpler than proxies.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * To ease the port:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Identify parts of your Solidity code that have analogues (ERC20 -> CW20, price oracles -> maybe Neutron Oracle or a stored price in contract, etc.).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Possibly break your design into modules and see if Cosmos has each piece: e.g., if you need a treasury and a governance, Cosmos has x/dao modules or you can just use on-chain governance proposals or a separate governance contract (like DAO DAO framework).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If rewriting seems too much, consider hiring or partnering with a CosmWasm developer – the Neutron community likely has people (perhaps funding hackathons to port Ethereum dApps).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * On the plus side, after porting, your protocol can immediately leverage Neutron’s new features. You might even improve it. For example, an Ethereum lending protocol might suffer from oracle latency – on Neutron you could use the chain’s oracle for instant price feeds per block, possibly reducing liquidation lag.

Documentations and this guide will help. There might also be a “Cosmos for EVM devs” workshop content from previous events (Cosmoverse often has such talks).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Q: Can I issue a token on Neutron and also use it on Ethereum (or other chains)?
 A: Yes. Thanks to IBC and bridges, your token can be omni-chain:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * If you issue on Neutron as the source, you can open IBC channels to other Cosmos chains and send your token over (it will appear as an IBC denom on those chains). For example, if you issue a stablecoin, you could deploy it to Osmosis through IBC for trading, to Cosmos Hub for use in other DeFi, etc. The token’s sovereignty remains on Neutron (minting/burning only on Neutron by your contract), ensuring supply is controlled.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * For Ethereum specifically, there is no IBC direct yet, but you can use a bridge (like Axelar or Gravity). For instance, you could have a bridge that takes your Neutron-native token and issues an ERC20 representation on Ethereum. That way Ethereum users can hold/trade it. You could also do vice versa: if your token originally is an ERC20, you bridge it into Neutron and then perhaps retire the ERC20 in favor of Neutron being the main issuance (some projects did similar migrations, like moving from ERC20 to Cosmos zone).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Neutron’s Skip API makes it easier for users to move between Ethereum and Neutron, so practically, yes, a token on Neutron can reach Ethereum folks fairly easily.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * If needed, you can even orchestrate cross-chain functionalities: e.g., your Neutron contract could, via Interchain Accounts, manage some aspect of an Ethereum contract if you set up a connection using protocols like Hyperlane (though that’s advanced).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * Essentially, Neutron does not isolate you – it connects you. So you get the best of both: a controlled environment to issue and manage your token, and pipelines to distribute it to other ecosystems. Many issuers will find that attractive, instead of being siloed on one chain.

 A: Likely:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Tutorial: “Launch a token on Neutron” could be a step-by-step where they guide a hypothetical issuer through writing or using a CW20 contract, deploying it, maybe setting up a basic yield mechanism (like a periodic interest distribution).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Reference: details of CW20 standard (though that’s in CosmWasm docs, but Neutron can link or summarize).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Provide a template repo: maybe Neutron can provide a Github template that has a skeleton CosmWasm contract for an issuer to fill in specifics (like interest rate logic).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * For EVM migration, maybe a guide “Adapting a Solidity contract to CosmWasm – by example” where they pick a simple contract (like a vesting contract or timelock) and show the Solidity version and Rust version side by side, explaining differences.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Q: Does Neutron have a devnet or testnet for me to try deploying before mainnet?
 A: Yes, Neutron had pion-1 testnet for Mercury rehearsals, and likely maintains a testnet for developers (maybe a perpetual one or a new one after Mercury). You should definitely use that to test your contracts. The DevRel team would provide info on endpoints, faucet for test tokens, etc. In docs, have a “Testnet” section with all that info.

Possibly incorporate tokenfactory as an alternative (and contrast when to use one vs the other – e.g., tokenfactory for simple fixed tokens or where you want native status; CW20 for complex logic like yield).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * If focusing on yield-bearing, maybe a specific guide: “Building a liquid staking token on Neutron”. Outline architecture including using ICA to stake, using Cron to auto-compound rewards, etc. This guide could be gold for any new chain LSD project considering where to launch.

E.g., Uniswap v3 -> there is a concentrated liquidity AMM in CosmWasm (part of Injective’s protocol maybe). Aave -> Mars Protocol is similar and in CosmWasm, could reference that design.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Neutron’s own code: If tokenfactory is enabled, check Neutron’s app.go or docs for how it’s configured (like what’s the denom creation fee if any).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * 21Shares or other TradFi: Possibly mention that even TradFi issuers (like someone making an ETP) could use Neutron as on-chain infrastructure. But that's an aside.

Finally, emphasize strategic alignment: Neutron’s “North Star” is capital efficiency, execution quality, and UX. Every feature like supervaults, integration patterns, and enabling issuers ties back to that. For issuers: capital efficiency means if you issue on Neutron, your asset can immediately be used in efficient markets (Duality and supervault), giving better execution (low slippage trades) which makes your asset more attractive, and good UX through all the integration stuff we talked about.
Module 7: Neutron Blockchain Fundamentals (Consensus, State & Gas Model)
Technical Overview
Neutron is built with the Cosmos technology stack: it uses Tendermint (CometBFT) consensus, the Cosmos SDK for its state machine, and integrates CosmWasm for smart contracts. While these are standard components, Neutron has tuned them for high performance and specific behaviors (like multi-denom gas fees). Understanding these fundamentals will help in optimizing dApps and running nodes if needed.
Consensus:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Neutron currently runs Tendermint BFT consensus, which gives instant finality (a block is final as soon as >2/3 validators sign it). With Mercury, block times are targeted to decrease from ~1.8s to eventually ~0.1s, which is extremely fast for Tendermint. Achieving 100ms block time likely requires future upgrades (perhaps using ABCI++ features or optimizations like Block-STM parallel execution). At launch, Mercury may stick to ~1s or sub-second by pushing Tendermint parameters (like lowering block timeout, mempool check times).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * The initial validator set is 20 validators, which is relatively small. This was to ensure stability during ICS exit. Over time, they’ll likely increase it (to 50, 100, etc.). A smaller set can reach consensus faster (less communication overhead), which helps with low latency.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Tendermint normally handles ~200–1000 tx/sec depending on tx size. With 11x gas per block, Neutron can handle more complex tx (lots of contract calls) per block, meaning it might process fewer tx per second if each uses a ton of gas, but it can process very heavy transactions that wouldn’t fit in other chains’ blocks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Fork Accountability: If a validator double-signs (equivocates), Tendermint has slashing (but Mercury temporarily disabled slashing). This means if by chance a double-sign happens now, there’s no automatic punishment, but governance could manually punish. This is a short-term compromise.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * The block proposers rotate (weighted by stake). With no slashing currently, liveness is encouraged by the performance threshold (must sign 95%+ blocks or presumably risk something like no base reward).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * For developers: finality means once you see your tx in a block, it’s done – no reorgs to worry about (unlike Ethereum’s probabilistic finality). This is great for e.g., exchanges or cross-chain operations (IBC relies on finality).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * If block time goes to 0.1s, network and processing become critical – validators must have top-notch hardware and connectivity. That’s part of Neutron’s ethos: pushing tech limits, but the validator set might remain somewhat smaller or professional for that reason.

State and Data:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Neutron uses the Cosmos SDK’s multi-store: each module (bank, staking, cron, wasm, etc.) has its own key-value store (Merkle tree). CosmWasm contracts each get a sub-store under the wasm module keyed by contract address.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * The application state is stored on validators (in .data directory if you run a node). Contracts can store quite a bit of data, but note the 330M gas limit – writing large state might cost a lot of gas. Typical throughput improvements came also from hardware – maybe validators upgrade to better SSD, etc., to handle more state write per block.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * State machine execution: A Cosmos block goes through DeliverTx for each tx sequentially. Mercury's performance boost hints at possibly enabling parallel transaction execution in future (there’s research like Optimint, Block-STM). If that comes, devs might have to consider transaction isolation and non-determinism issues, but currently, it’s sequential.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * CometBFT includes ABCI++ which allows tasks in different block stages (BeginBlock, EndBlock). Neutron uses EndBlock for Cron executions and oracle updates (enshrined in those modules). So, e.g., Cron’s scheduled messages run in EndBlock. Oracle price votes are tallied likely in EndBlock to set the price for next block. For devs, that means:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * If your contract query the oracle price during DeliverTx, you likely get last block’s price (since current block’s price will finalize at end of block).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Cron tasks will be executed after all txs, so they won’t affect transactions in the same block (only next block).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * IBC: The state includes light client states and pending IBC packets. Understanding that IBC operations (like sending a packet) happen in one block, and receipt (ack) come in another, is useful when designing cross-chain flows (discussed in Module 3).

Gas Model:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Gas in Cosmos is a unit of work (CPU, memory, I/O). Each CosmWasm opcode or SDK operation has a gas cost. Neutron raised block gas limit to 330M, but each transaction also has a gas limit (supplied by user).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Neutron likely keeps the default Cosmos SDK min gas price setting but extended to multiple denoms. Typically, a chain sets something like 0.0025 NTRN as min gas price. With multi-denom, they must have equivalences. Possibly they use an on-chain oracle or governance to set relative gas prices per token. For example, if NTRN is $0.10, and they want min gas price ~$0.0025, that’s 0.025 NTRN. If ATOM is $10, 0.0025 USD is 0.00025 ATOM. They might feed those rates in, or simpler, they could treat ATOM at some fixed ratio to NTRN. However, since they mention a 30% discount, it suggests a mechanism: maybe they set a base min gas price in USD, then say if paid in NTRN/ATOM, multiply required amount by 0.7.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * For developers, when sending transactions you specify gas (like 200k) and fee (say 200k * 0.025 NTRN = 5 NTRN). If paying in other denom, you ensure fee value meets requirement. The chain will accept or reject if not enough.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Gas consumption: The large block gas means you can do more in one tx (like loop over many items in a contract). But be mindful: just because the block can handle 330M doesn’t mean you should push one tx to use it all; that could be like 99% of block resources, and could be frowned upon or hit some per-tx limit. Cosmos might have a per-tx gas limit parameter too (some chains have like not more than half block gas per tx). Check Neutron’s config if any. If none, you could indeed have a monster tx that nearly fills a block. That’s useful for migration or batch jobs (e.g., a contract migration that updates a lot of state).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Gas and IBC: Relayer transactions paying in multi-denom fees should be fine as long as relayer software is updated to handle that. Possibly Neutron coordinates with relayers for ATOM or NTRN fees.

Storage Costs:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * In Cosmos, unlike Ethereum, there’s typically no rent for storage, but rather a one-time cost (gas to write) and sometimes chains charge an explicit fee for contract storage (some have “contract storage deposit” etc. Not sure if Neutron does). CosmWasm by default has an optional feature to charge a fee per byte of storage, but not all chains enable it. If Neutron’s concerned about state bloat, they might implement something like that or rely on gas costs to indirectly limit abuse.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * If you are storing large data on-chain (like an orderbook in a contract), know that reading/writing bigger storage is more gas.

Accounts and keys:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Neutron uses the standard Cosmos secp256k1 accounts (bech32 prefix neutron1...). It also supports Ethereum secp256k1 keys (different address format) as we discussed. Under the hood, both are elliptic curve keys – the chain likely has two PubKey types registered.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Account sequence and nonce: Cosmos tx include an account sequence for replay protection, similar to nonce in Ethereum. Developers should manage that (CosmJS and other libs do).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Module Accounts: Some tokens or funds are held by module accounts (like distribution module for fees, etc.). With ICS gone, now 25% fees aren’t going to Hub’s collector, presumably 100% of fees are either burnt, sent to community pool, or to stakers. Mercury proposal suggests 25% to Hub is removed, instead possibly fees are split differently (maybe all to stakers or partial burn as mentioned for ICS case was burn NTRN fees and send ATOM fees to Hub; now maybe they burn a portion of NTRN fees and keep ATOM in community pool).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * The treasury (community pool) is likely significant (especially they earmarked 4.2M NTRN for ATOM campaigns). That’s managed via governance proposals or by the foundation.

Upgrades and Governance:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Upgrades on Neutron (software upgrades) now can be faster since ICS is gone. They can use Cosmos’s on-chain proposal to coordinate a binary switch at block height (typical Cosmos governance for chain upgrade).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * The Mercury upgrade itself was coordinated via governance proposals on both Neutron and Hub. Now only Neutron’s own governance matters for its changes.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Developers should keep track of Neutron’s governance proposals, since changes in core (like enabling slashing, changing gas parameters, adding new modules) could affect their dApps.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Neutron likely has active governance – encourage developers to participate if their protocol relies on Neutron’s parameters (e.g., if you want your asset to be added to the fee token whitelist, you might propose that via governance).

Developer Analogy
Neutron’s blockchain fundamentals can be seen as a Formula 1 car compared to a normal car (typical blockchain). It’s tuned for speed (low block times, high gas capacity), but to harness it, one needs to understand the engine and track:

 A: If block times approach 0.1s, your contract executions must be efficient. You likely won’t get 0.1s immediately (that’s the goal by end of 2025), but even ~1s blocks are quick. This mainly means:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Don’t assume long time between blocks for things like time-based logic. For example, if you expected something to only run once per 5 seconds, on Neutron it might run 5 times in that span if triggered every block. Use block timestamps or heights for logic, not wall clock assumptions.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Oracle feeds are per-block – your contract could see prices update multiple times a second in future. Ensure your contract can handle that frequency if you subscribe to oracle results or Cron tasks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * From a user perspective, transactions confirm very fast, so you might need to throttle UI updates so you don’t overwhelm users with too many state changes per second (nice problem to have!). For algorithmic trading bots though, they’ll love it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * When testing locally (where block times might default to a few seconds in simulator), note that production will be faster, but logically things remain same.

 A: Not entirely. It’s a huge increase, but not infinite:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * If you write an extremely heavy loop (say iterating 1 million items in a contract), you might still exceed 330M gas – test and optimize. CosmWasm has some limits like a contract cannot have a message event with more than e.g. 1000 entries or so, but gas is main constraint.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Users still specify a gas limit per tx. Many wallets default to certain limits (e.g., 200k or 2 million). As a dev, if you know your contract call could use 50 million gas, you must instruct users (or programmatically set) to allow that gas and pay fee accordingly, or break the operation into multiple transactions/chunks if possible.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Long-term, if block times shorten, the effective computation per second might not scale linearly with gas, because while you have 330M per block, if blocks are 0.1s, that’s 10 blocks per second = 3.3B gas/sec network throughput theoretically, which is massive if achieved. More likely, there’ll be trade-offs (maybe they gradually raise gas as performance allows).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Gas costs for certain actions (like storing data) might be adjusted in future if needed to maintain performance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * So, enjoy the freedom but don’t be reckless—inefficient code can still rack up costs. And costs = fees for users, so optimize to keep fees low (which is part of UX focus too).

 A: After Mercury:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Fee distribution: Likely, 100% of transaction fees now stay within Neutron. Based on earlier ICS model, they might do something like: 30% of fees to community treasury, 70% to validators (either directly or via distribution module to delegators). Or they might burn a portion of NTRN fees to make NTRN deflationary. The forum snippet suggests “pay gas in any token, enjoy 30% discounts with NTRN and ATOM.” That implies they treat it as a discount rather than paying those to someone. Possibly that 30% is effectively eaten by treasury (i.e., if you pay in ATOM, they might send 0.3*fee to community or burn).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * We should confirm updated tokenomics. The Mercury text indicates an emphasis on growing NTRN value through use cases rather than heavy inflation. With only ~3% staking APR, fees and dApp usage become a key source of validator income. So likely most fees (especially if paid in NTRN) get distributed to validators (and thus to stakers, after validator commission).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * If fees are paid in other tokens (say USDC), the chain might convert them to NTRN or ATOM somewhere (maybe using an AMM or via governance periodically). Or store them in community pool to fund initiatives. They did mention ATOM fee use-case – perhaps ATOM fees go to a special pool to reward ATOM holders using Neutron DeFi (as part of that ATOM alignment program).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * For developers, this mainly matters if you plan an economic design that involves transaction fees (like some protocol might subsidize user fees or collect fee rebates). Knowing where fees go (like to stakers) indicates that heavy usage of chain indirectly benefits NTRN stakers, aligning with NTRN’s value accrual.

 A: Some possible limits:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Max tx size: Cosmos might limit by bytes (~1-2MB per tx perhaps). If you try to include extremely large messages or too many messages in one tx, you might hit a limit. This rarely affects typical use, but if you had a contract returning a huge dataset in query, that might be truncated by RPC limits (e.g., JSON RPC may have limits).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Max contract size: Wasm binaries have a limit (typically 800KB to 1MB). If migrating a complex Ethereum contract, ensure the compiled wasm is under limit. Rust optimizer helps; splitting into multiple contracts can circumvent if needed.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * IBC channel limits: a single contract can open multiple ICA/ICQ channels, but there might be practical limits (like not spamming thousands of channels). Each channel consumes state and some gas.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Time interrupts: In CosmWasm, if a contract loop uses too much gas, it stops. This is just normal gas exhaustion.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Entropy: If you need randomness, since block time is short and many events are predictable, consider using beacons (perhaps Neutron’s oracle VRF in future). Don’t attempt to use block height or time as pseudo-random (predictable).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Precision: Cosmos SDK uses integers for tokens (no decimals type, just consider decimals via denom conventions). NTRN likely has 6 or 7 decimal places (not sure, could be 6 as common). ATOM had 6. So handle those units properly in calculations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Chain ID: use the correct chain-id “neutron-...” when signing tx, as Ethereum signatures or any cosmos libs require that to avoid replay across chains.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * Q: How do I run a Neutron node or dev environment? (Not directly asked, but devs might want to.) A:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Running a full node: You can use neutrond (Neutron’s daemon, if they provide it) to join testnet or mainnet. Config is similar to any Cosmos chain (edit config.toml for seeds, etc.). This is more for validators or if you need your own endpoint for testing.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * For development, often using the testnet is fine. But one could also run a local Neutron network (maybe neutrond start --dev or via Docker compose). If Neutron’s repo has a local one-node config, docs should mention it. Possibly they rely on the official CosmWasm dev suite (wasmd) for simple local testing since Neutron adds mainly modules on top of wasmd.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * The integration tests repo suggests they spin up ephemeral chains for testing contracts.

Wrap up fundamentals: Neutron inherits Cosmos's reliability and adds its enhancements. As a developer, understanding these ensures you make the most of Neutron (like leveraging fast finality for quick cross-chain confirmations, or choosing the right fee token to minimize costs) and avoid pitfalls (like not expecting a 15s block cushion you might be used to on Ethereum for batch processing – on Neutron things happen NOW).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Comparison: "Neutron vs Cosmos Hub vs Ethereum" in terms of block time, throughput, finality, etc., just to set context.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Security Considerations: Reiterate that fast finality means if something goes wrong (bug), chain halts or upgrade needed – there's no minor rollback. But that’s typical for BFT chains. Also mention that Neutron is new and pushing limits, but had audits etc.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * CometBFT (Tendermint) docs for advanced reading on how consensus works, which might interest devs coming from different background.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * ABCI++ and parallel execution: If Neutron plans to adopt something like that, track CometBFT or Cosmos SDK releases. Possibly by end of 2025, they might incorporate something like Turbo++ or Optimint. Being aware of those developments can help devs future-proof contracts (e.g., avoiding unnecessary inter-tx dependencies).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Cosmos SDK docs: For how gas and fees are handled, multi-denom fee (there’s an x/feegrant and x/txfees module used by Osmosis to allow multiple fee tokens – Neutron may use similar).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Block explorers: Using a Neutron block explorer can help devs see gas usage of their transactions, etc. Mintscan or a Neutron-specific explorer should be mentioned.

With fundamentals understood, developers can optimize their dApps for Neutron’s environment – for instance, taking advantage of fast blocks to do more frequent batching or using the knowledge of finality to simplify cross-chain state assumptions. It also helps in troubleshooting (knowing, e.g., if something fails, whether it's likely due to gas, or if the oracle update hadn’t happened yet in that block, etc.).
Finally, tying back to strategic goals: The way Neutron has configured its fundamentals (high throughput, discounted fees for certain tokens, etc.) all serve the goal of making usage cheap and efficient, thereby attracting volume and liquidity – which feeds into capital efficiency and user experience.

By going through all these modules, a Developer Relations Engineer will have a holistic understanding of Neutron – from high-level strategy down to low-level mechanics – enabling them to produce rich technical content, guide developers, and demonstrate mastery at the upcoming leadership off-site. Each module’s content can be further broken into separate documentation sections or presentation chapters as needed, and the modular format ensures the information is organized and digestible.
