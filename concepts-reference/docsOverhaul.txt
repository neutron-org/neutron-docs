[WIP] Documentation Overhaul Strategy

Current policy:

[[WIP] Neutron team documentation policy](https://www.notion.so/WIP-Neutron-team-documentation-policy-14485d6b9b10808e92b8e309fdf70d91?pvs=21) 

## Executive Summary

The current documentation system at `docs.neutron.org` is fragmented, outdated, and structurally inconsistent. With Mercury live, v6.0.0-rc.0 released, and strategic products and modules like Supervaults, Oracle, Cron now live or nearing deployment, it's time to comprehensively **reboot Neutron’s documentation stack**.

Time for a **ground-up rewrite of the documentation** using the [Divio documentation system](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system) and implemented using [Mintlify](https://www.mintlify.com/), taking structural inspiration from docs of exemplary projects like [Initia](https://docs.initia.xyz/home/general/welcome), [Penumbra](https://guide.penumbra.zone/), [Valence](https://docs.valence.zone/).

## 🔍 Problem Statement

### 🧱 Technical Debt in Docs

- Most existing content (outside the onboarding tutorials) is outdated, casual in tone, and decoupled from real source-of-truth updates (RFCs, Notion, PRs).
- Tutorials, module pages, and contract docs have not been consistently updated with recent changes to Neutron’s codebase (Cron, Fee, Oracle, ICQ/ICA).
- Developers + Users don’t know what’s obsolete and what’s current.

### 🧑‍💻 Process Misalignment

- Current expectation is that **core devs update docs alongside PRs**, but this doesn’t cover:
    - Tutorials
    - FAQ
    - Conceptual explanations
- RFCs (which are well-written) often don’t propagate into public-facing docs.
- No clear ownership of docs outside core modules.

### 🎯 Undefined End Users

- Some unclarity exists on **who the documentation is for**:
    - Smart contract developers (CosmWasm)
    - Chain integrators/infra teams
    - Users depositing/interacting with vaults
    - Validators/relayers
- Lack of structure means none of these are fully served.

---

## 🧩 Proposed Solution

## 🧑‍🔬 Contribution Workflow

### **High-Level Workflow Steps To Be**

1. RFC is written in Notion → reviewed by Andrei/Mikhail.
2. If approved and merged to core repo, *dev or DevRel* writes:
    - `Explanation` page (why it exists, how it works)
    - `Reference` (from proto and implementation)
    - Optional: `How-To` if usage isn’t self-evident.
3. Markdown synced to Mintlify via GitHub.
4. Final approval by DevRel or doc editor.

add a note: **"Versioning disabled by default (v6.0.0+ only); archive old versions if necessary."**

**Contributor Roles**

- *Core Devs*: responsible for module-level docs (reference + API) as part of PR process.
- *DevRel*: maintains tutorials, explanation content, and How-Tos.
- *Reviewers*: ensure docs PRs meet Divio format, include references, and use AI-enhanced copy.
- *Infra*: maintains Mintlify, Kapa, syncing infra.

### 📚 Enforce  Divio’s 4-Quadrant System

Each piece of documentation must serve **one of four purposes** and be written accordingly:

| Section | Purpose | Form | Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Tutorials** | Learning | Step-by-step walkthroughs | Teaching a child to cook |
| **How-To Guides** | Solving specific problems | Recipes | Cookbook recipe |
| **Reference** | Factual interface details | API definitions, schemas | Encyclopedia |
| **Explanation** | Deep conceptual understanding | Essays, rationales | History of cuisine |

We model this structure on @Sergei Sotnikov’s  [ICQ module refactor (PR #219)](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-docs/pull/219) and extend it across **all modules, contracts, and primitives**.

---

## 👥 Core Audiences

| Persona | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Users | Core concepts, Security model, vault logic, staking flow, tokenomics, governance model,  things that help verify authenticity (asset denominations, deployed contracts), privileged subdaos |
| Developers | Code examples, integrations, SDKs, ICA/ICQ use cases, architecture rationale, Tutorials, Orderbook integrations,  Vaults, Gas abstraction, potentially Ethereum onboarding docs (which could lead to a future subgroup) |
| Validators | Validator incentives, slashing removal, machine specs, param recommendations, how to get in the set etc., how the curation policy works |

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **~~Approve Divio-based IA & audience model~~**
2. **~~Approve plan to discard most of legacy docs (except tutorials)~~**
    1. We’ll keep some, ICQ will be our best example for now (https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-docs/blob/feat/refactor-icq-module-documentation/docs/neutron/modules/interchain-queries/how-to.md)
3. **Begin with:**
    - Refactor `cron` module using Divio layout
        - Clyde to use AI and make no-slop docs and share how to
    - Introduce docs for using the `oracle` module and reference [Skip documentation](https://github.com/neutron-org/slinky-vault/tree/supervault-auditspec) on that point (recently under-documented)
4. **Create editorial checklist** for every doc PR / Changelog
    1. To come to agreement on template

Priveleges, chain managers, 

Sponsoring signs of life: we need ideas and scaffolds

Docs feedback: 

quickstart should be just with cosmopark (https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/build-and-run/cosmopark, should be able to condense all the steps)

deploydon to send me bull v bear scaffolding const (variables), lib (functions), run (open, close, build here)

add deploydons scaffolding to developers tabs, and for bull v bear, 

need to add some kind of neutron-std vs. sdk documentation and understand that better 

Need to add some slinky set-up for node operators

Improper gas documentation:

gas cost is based on memory usage and compute per call, it doesn't really matter the amount of contracts its calling on the gas cost

that's not really documented anywhere, wow

that sucks, the anti-monolithic sdk is against micro-service style for contracts

Decimals incorrect

🖼 why is the decimals wrong by 5 places?

"NIL/USD":"3768039074"

Each price has a different decimal value. IIRC NIL is 10

Most are 9-10

even locked allos bought at pennies were likely sold to other parties for a gain, thats typically how that works

quite possible, i dont know about seed investors but i do know some of their later stage private round investors bought OTC after launch to double down

i generally think Celestia's investors seem pretty long term focused

but i could be massively wrong

ok, got the decimals from

which is incorrecty documented. But at least I can get the correct price for any newly listed assets without relying on offchain data or updating my script
neutrond q maketmap market-map

> Rarma_:
🖼 $390 profit on the bot today, one trade at a loss (which opened incorrectly because of NIL - previous script didnt automatically get the decimals so my bot thought the price was higher)

And two active trades.

Did you mean this?
market-map

@Spaydh I have a script you can run to check for incorrect queries in your documentation
