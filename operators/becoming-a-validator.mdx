This guide will help you join Neutron's validator set after you have [set up your node](/validators/running-a-node) and [configured your oracle service](/validators/oracle-setup).

<Note>
  The Neutron DAO maintains a curated set of 20 validators selected based on performance metrics and technical capabilities. New validators are added when slots become available through the DAO's rotation policy.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. **Full Node Setup**: A fully synced Neutron node running the latest version
2. **Oracle Configuration**: Properly configured Slinky oracle service
3. **NTRN Tokens**: Sufficient NTRN tokens for self-delegation (minimum 1 NTRN)
4. **Monitoring**: Monitoring and alerting systems to maintain high performance

## Validator Selection Process

The Neutron DAO implements a transparent selection process for validators, based on:

1. **Technical Performance**: Validators must consistently meet or exceed performance thresholds
2. **Dual Network Requirement**: Operators must run nodes on both mainnet and testnet
3. **Prioritization**: Eligible operators are prioritized by reverse order of mainnet voting power


### Rotation Criteria

Validators may be rotated out of the active set under the following conditions determined by the Neutron DAO:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Performance-Based Offboarding">
    A validator is considered for offboarding if:
    
    - **Consecutive Performance Failure**: No rewards from x/revenue for two months in a row
      - Notified after first month
      - Flagged for rotation after second consecutive month
    - **Intermittent Performance Issues**: No rewards from x/revenue for three months in a 6-month period
      - Notified after second month within a 6-month period
      - Flagged for rotation after third missed month
    - **Tombstoning**: Validator was tombstoned
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Downtime-Based Offboarding">
    A validator is considered for offboarding if:
    
    - **Resumption Latency**: Failed to resume signing within 60 minutes of the first finalized block after a successful upgrade
    - **Precommit Latency**: Failed to begin precommitting within 2 hours of the distribution of correct upgrade instructions
    
    In both cases, validators are notified on the first occurrence and marked for rotation on the second.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Onboarding Process

When a slot becomes available, the Neutron DAO selects new validators according to the following process:

1. Must run both mainnet and testnet nodes
2. Eligible operators are prioritized by reverse order of mainnet voting power 
3. Selected operators initially receive a small delegation from the DAO
4. After demonstrating adequate performance for three months, they will receive a full delegation
5. If they fail to perform adequately, the DAO will redelegate to the next operator in line

## Creating Your Validator

### Step 1: Create a Wallet

First, create a wallet for your validator:

```bash
neutrond keys add <wallet-name>
```

Save the mnemonic phrase in a secure location. This wallet will be used for managing your validator.

### Step 2: Obtain NTRN Tokens

You'll need NTRN tokens to stake. These can be obtained from:

- Exchanges that list NTRN
- Purchasing ATOM and using IBC transfer to Neutron
- The community (Discord/Telegram) for testnet tokens

### Step 3: Submit the Create Validator Transaction

Once your node is synced and you have NTRN tokens, register your validator:

```bash
neutrond tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=1000000untrn \
  --pubkey=$(neutrond tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="<your-validator-name>" \
  --website="<your-website>" \
  --details="<description>" \
  --security-contact="<email>" \
  --chain-id=neutron-1 \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-adjustment="1.5" \
  --gas-prices="0.025untrn" \
  --from=<wallet-name>
```

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

## Verify Your Validator

After submitting the transaction, verify that your validator was created:

```bash
neutrond query staking validators --limit 1000 -o json | jq '.validators[] | select(.description.moniker=="<your-validator-name>")'
```

You can also check your validator status on Neutron block explorers:

- [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/neutron)
- [Ping.pub](https://ping.pub/neutron)

## Security and Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dedicated Machine" icon="server" iconType="duotone">
    Run your validator on a dedicated machine separate from other services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Firewall Configuration" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
    Allow only necessary ports (26656, 26657, etc.) and use SSH key authentication
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sentry Architecture" icon="network-wired" iconType="duotone">
    Deploy sentry nodes to protect your validator from DDoS attacks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key Management" icon="key" iconType="duotone">
    Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) for key management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Monitoring Performance

Set up comprehensive monitoring to ensure your validator meets performance requirements:

- Block signing rate (minimum 95%, target 99.5%)
- Oracle price updates (minimum 95%, target 98%)
- System resource utilization
- Network connectivity

Popular monitoring solutions include:

- Prometheus + Grafana
- Cosmos Validator Monitoring
- TenderDuty

## Maintaining Eligibility

To maintain your position in the validator set and remain eligible for DAO delegations:

1. **Stay Updated**: Keep your node software updated to the latest version
2. **Active Upgrades**: Participate promptly in network upgrades
3. **Community Participation**: Join validator discussions and governance
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure you consistently meet or exceed performance thresholds
5. **Run a Testnet Node**: Maintain an active testnet validator alongside your mainnet node
