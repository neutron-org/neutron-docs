Neutron network operators maintain critical infrastructure including validators, oracles, relayers, and API/RPC nodes. Following the Mercury upgrade in April 2025, Neutron transitioned to a fully sovereign network with expanded opportunities for network participation.

## Neutron's Validator Model

Neutron's validator model differs fundamentally from traditional Proof of Stake networks:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="Fixed Supply" icon="coins">
    No inflation-based block rewards, preserving NTRN's fixed supply economics
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAO Treasury" icon="building-columns">
    All rewards paid directly from the DAO treasury instead of inflation

  <Card title="No Slashing" icon="shield-check">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Base Compensation" icon="money-bill">
    $3,000/month for validators meeting performance requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Performance Requirements

Validators operate under strict performance criteria, with rewards tied directly to maintaining high-quality service:

| Performance Criterion | Minimum Threshold | Full Reward Threshold |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Block Signing         | 95%               | 99.5%                |
| Oracle Price Updates  | 95%               | 98%                  |

Validators who fail to meet minimum thresholds for two consecutive months or three months in a six-month period may be rotated out of the active set by the Neutron DAO.

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Specifications

  <Card title="CPU" icon="microchip" iconType="duotone">
    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 4+ cores<br />
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> 8+ cores, AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D or EPYC 4584PX for optimal single-thread performance

    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 64 GB<br />
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> 128 GB+ for optimal performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage" icon="hard-drive" iconType="duotone">
    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 2 TB NVMe SSD<br />
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> 4 TB+ with ≥10,000 IOPS and ≥500 MB/s sustained read/write

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Validator Selection & Rotation

### Selection Process

When validator slots become available:

1. **Eligibility**: Must operate both mainnet and testnet nodes
2. **Prioritization**: Operators prioritized by reverse order of voting power (encouraging decentralization)
3. **Probation**: 3-month trial period with limited delegation
4. **Full Status**: Receive full DAO delegation after successful probation

### Rotation Framework

Validators may be rotated out for:

- **Performance Issues**: No rewards for 2 consecutive months or 3 months in 6-month period
- **Upgrade Delays**: Failure to resume signing within 60 minutes of upgrade or begin precommitting within 2 hours of instructions
- **Tombstoning**: Double-signing or critical security issues

## Mercury Upgrade

The Mercury upgrade in April 2025 marked a pivotal transition for Neutron, moving from Interchain Security (ICS) to a fully sovereign network. This enabled:

- Native NTRN staking with fixed supply tokenomics
- Performance improvements with reduced latency (~100ms) and increased throughput
- Better stability for the High Frequency Oracle and other infrastructure
- Faster upgrades and incident response capabilities

## Operator Types

Neutron supports various types of network operators:
