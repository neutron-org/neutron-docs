Neutron's High Frequency Oracle is a critical component of the network that provides accurate price data for various assets. As a validator, you must run the Connect price oracle service alongside your node to meet performance requirements.

## Overview

Connect is Neutron's price oracle service that fetches market prices from various providers and makes them available to the Neutron blockchain. Connect is forked from [Skip-mev's Connect oracle](https://github.com/skip-mev/connect) and maintained by the Neutron team at [neutron-org/connect](https://github.com/neutron-org/connect).

Running Connect properly ensures that your validator contributes accurate price data to the network, which is essential for:

- Meeting validator performance thresholds
- Enabling DeFi applications that require accurate price feeds
- Supporting financial operations on the network

<Note>
  Oracle price update reliability is one of the key performance metrics for Neutron validators. You must maintain at least 95% success rate for oracle price updates to receive rewards.

## Installation Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pre-built Binary">
    Download the latest stable version of Connect:
    
    ```bash
    # Download Connect v1.2.1 (or latest version)
    wget https://github.com/neutron-org/connect/releases/download/v1.2.1/connect-linux-amd64
    sudo mv connect-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/connect
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/connect
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Build from Source">
    Clone and build Connect from source:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neutron-org/connect.git
    cd connect
    git checkout v1.2.1  # Use the latest version
    make install
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

You can configure Connect using one of the following methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Method 1: SystemD Service">
    Create a systemd service file to manage the Connect service:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /var/log/connect
    sudo touch /var/log/connect/sidecar.log
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/log/connect
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/connect.service
    ```

    Add the following content:

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Connect Price Oracle Service
    After=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=$USER
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/connect --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --market-map-endpoint="127.0.0.1:9090" --log-file="/var/log/connect/sidecar.log"
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=3
    LimitNOFILE=65535

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    <Warning>
      Replace `$USER` with your actual username and adjust the path to the Connect binary as needed. The `--market-map-endpoint` should point to your node's gRPC port.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Method 2: Configuration File">
    Create a configuration file for Connect:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /usr/local/connect
    nano /usr/local/connect/oracle.json
    ```

    Add the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "port": "8080",
      "metrics": {
        "prometheusServerAddress": "0.0.0.0:8001"
      },
      "providers": {
        "marketmap_api": {
          "api": {
            "endpoints": [
              {
                "url": "localhost:9090"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Then create a systemd service file to use this configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/connect.service
    ```

    Add the following content:

    ```
    [Unit]
    After=network-online.target
    Description=connect service

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/connect --oracle-config /usr/local/connect/oracle.json
    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/default/connect
    Type=simple
    RestartSec=1
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configure Neutron Node

Edit the Neutron node's `app.toml` file to enable the oracle:

```bash
nano $HOME/.neutrond/config/app.toml
```

Find the `[oracle]` section and update it:

```toml
[oracle]
enabled = "true"
oracle_address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
client_timeout = "2s"
metrics_enabled = "true"
price_ttl = "10s"
interval = "1500ms"
prometheus_server_address = "0.0.0.0:8001"
```

<Warning>
  Make sure to use lowercase `true` for boolean values, not capitalized `True`. Also ensure gRPC is enabled in your `app.toml`.
</Warning>

## Starting the Service

Enable and start the Connect service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable connect
sudo systemctl start connect
```

Check the status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status connect
```

## Verification

Verify that your Connect oracle is working correctly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Connect Logs">
    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u connect -f
    ```
    
    Look for successful connection messages and price updates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Oracle Metrics">
    ```bash
    curl -s http://localhost:26660 | grep 'app_oracle_responses'
    ```
    
    You should see output similar to:
    
    ```
    # HELP app_oracle_responses The number of oracle responses
    # TYPE app_oracle_responses gauge
    app_oracle_responses{chain_id="neutron-1",status="Failure"} 128
    app_oracle_responses{chain_id="neutron-1",status="Success"} 841042
    ```
    
    If you see `Success` values increasing, your setup is working correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing Prices">
    If you see log entries like:
    
    ```
    {"level":"info","ts":"2025-04-22T06:42:51.970Z","caller":"oracle/aggregator.go:134","msg":"failed to calculate prices for price feeds","pid":2469887,"process":"index_price_aggregator","missing_prices":["RNDR/USD","AGIX/USD","SAGA/USD","MATIC/USD"]}
    ```
    
    This is normal and can be ignored. It indicates that some price feeds are temporarily unavailable from providers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="WebSocket Errors">
    If you see errors like:
    
    ```
    {"level":"error","ts":"2025-04-22T06:43:03.168Z","caller":"base/fetch.go:130","msg":"websocket query handler returned error","pid":2469887,"process":"oracle","provider":"binance_ws","error":"failed to start connection: websocket connection handler failed to write message\nwrite tcp 88.211.218.89:22360->35.79.60.252:443: write: broken pipe"}
    ```
    
    These are typically transient connection issues with price providers and can be ignored as long as your oracle responses show successful metrics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configuration Issues">
    Common configuration issues include:
    
    1. Make sure the `market-map-endpoint` in your configuration points to the correct gRPC port of your Neutron node.
    2. Ensure all boolean values in `app.toml` use lowercase `true` not capitalized `True`.
    3. Verify that your Neutron node's gRPC service is enabled and running.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring

Set up monitoring for your oracle service to ensure it maintains the required performance thresholds:

```bash
# Create a simple monitoring script
cat > /usr/local/bin/check-oracle.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

TOTAL=$(curl -s http://localhost:26660 | grep 'app_oracle_responses{chain_id="neutron-1",status="Success"}' | awk '{print $2}')
FAILURES=$(curl -s http://localhost:26660 | grep 'app_oracle_responses{chain_id="neutron-1",status="Failure"}' | awk '{print $2}')

SUCCESS_RATE=$(awk "BEGIN {print ($TOTAL / ($TOTAL + $FAILURES)) * 100}")

echo "Oracle success rate: $SUCCESS_RATE%"

if (( $(echo "$SUCCESS_RATE < 95" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "WARNING: Oracle success rate below 95%"
fi
EOF

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check-oracle.sh
```

<Note>
  This simple script checks the success rate of your oracle responses. You can expand it to send alerts via Telegram, Discord, or email when the success rate falls below the threshold.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your Connect binary updated to the latest version from [neutron-org/connect](https://github.com/neutron-org/connect)
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure proper firewall rules to allow Connect to access external price providers
- **Log Rotation**: Configure log rotation for Connect logs to prevent disk space issues
- **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring for oracle performance with alerting
