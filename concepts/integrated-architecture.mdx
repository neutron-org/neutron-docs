Neutron implements an integrated blockchain architecture that combines critical DeFi infrastructure directly at the protocol layer. This design ensures guaranteed execution, native cross-chain communication, atomic composability, and predictable performanceâ€”creating a shared environment where DeFi protocols benefit from specialized infrastructure without sacrificing interoperability.

## Core Infrastructure Components

  <Card title="Oracle Module" icon="bolt" iconType="duotone" href="/developers/modules/oracle">
    Native price feeds updated every block with hardware-based security, eliminating dependence on external oracles and providing superior execution guarantees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interchain Queries (ICQ)" icon="network-wired" iconType="duotone" href="/developers/modules/interchain-queries">
    Direct state queries across any IBC-connected chain, enabling real-time cross-chain data access without trusted third parties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cron Module" icon="clock" iconType="duotone" href="/developers/modules/cron">
    Native automation allowing scheduled and conditional contract execution with protocol-level reliability.

## Atomic Composability

Neutron enables true atomic composability across all protocol features within a single transaction:

  A --> D[Interchain Query]
  A --> E[Cron Automation]
  
  B & C & D & E -.-> F[Unified Transaction State]

  classDef contract fill:#0ea5e9,stroke:#0284c7,color:white

```

All operations execute atomically in a single transaction context, providing developers with strong guarantees while eliminating interoperability risks.

## Real-World Applications

### Supervaults
Supervaults represent a new approach to liquidity provision that overcomes the limitations of traditional AMMs. By leveraging Neutron's built-in high-frequency oracle and native automation features, Supervaults can:

- Market make at the most recent CEX prices
- Automatically rebalance every block
- Perform arbitrage themselves instead of being arbitraged
- Democratize profits to liquidity providers

### Cross-Chain Liquid Staking
Protocols can utilize Neutron's Interchain Accounts and Interchain Queries (ICQ) capabilities to:

- Read the state of other blockchains
- Adjust delegations made by remotely controlled accounts
- Onboard new assets from connected chains with a single transaction
- Provide users with a seamless cross-chain staking experiences
