Neutron's proof-of-liquid-staking model reimagines traditional PoS economics with a fixed token supply, delegator protection, and deep liquid staking integrationâ€”creating sustainable security while enabling capital to remain productive in DeFi.

## Core Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fixed Supply & Performance-Based Rewards" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
    No inflation or block rewards. All staking rewards come from the Neutron DAO Treasury, with validators compensated based on strict performance metrics rather than token inflation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Delegator Protection & Capital Efficiency" icon="shield-halved" iconType="duotone">
    No slashing for delegators eliminates asset reduction risk, while staked NTRN can be represented as liquid tokens and used throughout the ecosystem.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Economic Structure

**Validator Compensation**: $3,000 USD per month base compensation with performance-based adjustments. No commissions on delegator rewards, creating clear role separation.

**Delegator Rewards**: Stable 3% target APR funded by the Treasury, with options to magnify returns through DeFi participation and no slashing risk.

**Security Model**: Network security is maintained through jailing and tombstoning for misbehavior, DAO treasury staking, curated validator selection, and strict performance requirements for block signing and oracle updates.

## Liquid Staking Innovation

<div className="p-4 border-l-4 border-primary bg-primary/5 rounded my-6">
  <strong>The most innovative aspect of Neutron's staking model is its deep integration of liquid staking:</strong>
  <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2">
    <li>The network actively encourages liquid staking derivatives like dNTRN</li>
    <li>Staked NTRN can be represented as liquid tokens and used throughout the ecosystem</li>
    <li>Capital simultaneously secures the network and participates in DeFi applications</li>
    <li>DAO stakes a significant treasury portion with validators for network security</li>
    <li>Staked NTRN provides governance voting power through dedicated vaults without unstaking</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Curated Validator Set

Neutron implements a focused validation approach where validators concentrate on reliable infrastructure rather than governance representation. **Selection criteria** include historical performance, technical expertise, commitment to high uptime, and regular oracle price updates. **Specialized roles** ensure validators focus on infrastructure while governance remains separate with performance-based incentives.

## Advantages Over Traditional Models

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sustainable & Predictable Economics" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    No inflation preserves token value while both validators and delegators receive stable, predictable compensation regardless of market conditions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Reduced Risk & Capital Efficiency" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
    No slashing protects delegators from validator misbehavior, while liquid staking eliminates opportunity cost by allowing simultaneous network security and DeFi participation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Aligned Incentives**: The DAO, validators, and users share aligned goals for network growth and sustainability, with simplified staking mechanics encouraging broader participation through lower entry barriers.

## Technical Implementation

The liquid staking model operates through several integrated mechanisms:

- **x/revenue Module**: Tracks validator performance and distributes rewards according to service quality metrics. See the [Revenue Module](/developers/modules/revenue/overview) for technical details.
- **Staked NTRN Voting Vault**: Ensures native stakers can participate in governance without unstaking their tokens.
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Strategic deployment of treasury assets secures the network while fostering ecosystem growth.
