Neutron's proof-of-liquid-staking model reimagines traditional PoS economics with a fixed token supply, delegator protection, and deep liquid staking integrationâ€”creating sustainable security while enabling capital to remain productive in DeFi.

## Core Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fixed Supply & Performance-Based Rewards" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
    No inflation or block rewards. All staking rewards come from the Neutron DAO Treasury, with validators compensated based on strict performance metrics rather than token inflation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Delegator Protection & Capital Efficiency" icon="shield-halved" iconType="duotone">
    No slashing for delegators eliminates asset reduction risk, while staked NTRN can be represented as liquid tokens and used throughout the ecosystem.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Economic Structure

**Validator Compensation**: $3,000 USD per month base compensation with performance-based adjustments. No commissions on delegator rewards, creating clear role separation.

**Delegator Rewards**: Stable 3% target APR funded by the Treasury, with options to magnify returns through DeFi participation.

## Liquid Staking Innovation

<div className="p-4 border-l-4 border-primary bg-primary/5 rounded my-6">
  <strong>The most innovative aspect of Neutron's staking model is its deep integration of liquid staking:</strong>
  <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2">
    <li>The network actively encourages liquid staking derivatives like dNTRN</li>
    <li>Staked NTRN can be represented as liquid tokens and used throughout the ecosystem</li>
    <li>Capital simultaneously secures the network and participates in DeFi applications</li>
    <li>DAO stakes a significant treasury portion with validators for network security</li>
    <li>Staked NTRN provides governance voting power through dedicated vaults without unstaking</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Advantages Over Traditional Models

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sustainable Economics" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    No inflation preserves token value while Treasury funding provides stable, predictable compensation for both validators and delegators.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Capital Efficiency" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
    Liquid staking eliminates opportunity cost by allowing simultaneous network security participation and DeFi yield generation.
  </Card>

## Technical Implementation

The liquid staking model operates through several integrated mechanisms:

- **x/revenue Module**: Tracks validator performance and distributes rewards according to service quality metrics. See the [Revenue Module](/developers/modules/revenue/overview) for technical details.
- **Staked NTRN Voting Vault**: Ensures native stakers can participate in governance without unstaking their tokens.
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Strategic deployment of treasury assets secures the network while fostering ecosystem growth.
