# Neutron Architecture

Neutron is built using the Cosmos SDK and implements a module-based architecture that provides native support for DeFi operations across blockchains. This page explains the key architectural components that developers should understand when building on Neutron.

## Key Architectural Features

Neutron differentiates itself from other Cosmos chains by integrating critical DeFi infrastructure directly at the protocol layer:

### Atomic Composability

All operations within a Neutron transaction execute atomically, maintaining a unified transaction state:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Smart Contract] --> B[Oracle Price Check]
  A --> C[Token Transfer]
  A --> D[Cross-chain Query]
  A --> E[Scheduled Action]
  
  B & C & D & E -.-> F[Unified Transaction State]

  classDef contract fill:#0ea5e9,stroke:#0284c7,color:white
  
  class A contract
```

Atomicity ensures that cross-contract calls, external API interactions, and module operations either all succeed or all fail together.

### Module Architecture

Neutron consists of a collection of specialized modules that work together to provide its unique functionality:

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Integration

Neutron uses CosmWasm to execute WebAssembly-based smart contracts. This architecture allows contracts to:

1. Message other contracts atomically
2. Call into any of Neutron's custom modules
3. Initiate interchain operations to other blockchains
4. Schedule actions for future execution

```rust
// Example: Smart contract integrating with various Neutron modules
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        // Call into Oracle module to get price data
        ExecuteMsg::GetPrice { denom } => {
            let oracle_query = QueryRequest::Custom(NeutronQuery::OraclePrice { denom });
            let price: PriceResponse = deps.querier.query(&oracle_query)?;
            
            // Use price data...
            Ok(Response::new().add_attribute("price", price.price.to_string()))
        },
        
        // Register an interchain query
        ExecuteMsg::QueryRemoteChain { connection_id, remote_address } => {
            let icq_msg = NeutronMsg::RegisterInterchainQuery {
                query_type: QueryType::KV {
                    connection_id,
                    keys: vec![Key {
                        path: format!("bank/balances/{}", remote_address),
                        key: Binary::from(b""),
                    }],
                },
                transactions_filter: TransactionsFilterType::None,
                update_period: 10,
            };
            
            Ok(Response::new()
                .add_message(icq_msg)
                .add_attribute("action", "register_icq"))
        },
        
        // Schedule a future action
        ExecuteMsg::ScheduleRebalance { time } => {
            let cron_msg = NeutronMsg::CreateCronTask {
                task: CronTask {
                    name: "rebalance".to_string(),
                    period: time.to_string(),
                    msgs: vec![WasmMsg::Execute {
                        contract_addr: env.contract.address.to_string(),
                        msg: to_binary(&ExecuteMsg::Rebalance {})?,
                        funds: vec![],
                    }
                    .into()],
                },
            };
            
            Ok(Response::new()
                .add_message(cron_msg)
                .add_attribute("action", "schedule_rebalance"))
        },
        
        // Other message handlers...
        _ => Err(ContractError::InvalidMessage {}),
    }
}
```

### Module Interaction Flow

When building on Neutron, your contracts typically interact with the blockchain's architecture in this pattern:

1. **Contract Initialization**: Set up your contract state and configurations
2. **External Module Integration**: Register interchain queries, schedule tasks, etc.
3. **State Management**: Handle state changes based on messages and queries
4. **Event Emission**: Broadcast events for indexers and subscribers
5. **Response Handling**: Manage success/failure cases and state transitions

## Module System Architecture

Neutron extends the Cosmos SDK module system with specialized modules for DeFi applications:

```

├── types/              # Common type definitions
└── x/                  # Custom Neutron modules
    ├── interchainqueries/  # Interchain query module
    ├── interchaintxs/      # Interchain transaction module
    ├── cron/               # Automated task scheduling

    ├── feeburner/          # Fee burning mechanism
    └── feerefunder/        # Fee refund for IBC operations
```

## Network Architecture

Neutron's network architecture is based on a hub-and-spoke model, where Neutron acts as a specialized DeFi hub connected to other chains through IBC:

```mermaid
graph TB
    N[Neutron] --- IBC
    IBC --- C[Cosmos Hub]
    IBC --- O[Osmosis]
    IBC --- J[Juno]
    IBC --- S[Secret Network]
    IBC --- A[Other IBC Chains]

    classDef chain fill:#65a30d,stroke:#4d7c0f,color:white
    
    class N neutron
    class IBC ibc
    class C,O,J,S,A chain
```

## Architectural Best Practices

When building on Neutron, consider these architectural best practices:

1. **Leverage Native Modules**: Use Neutron's built-in modules for oracle data, automation, and cross-chain operations instead of implementing these yourself.

2. **Design for Composability**: Structure your contracts to be easily composed with other DeFi protocols on Neutron.

3. **Optimize Gas Usage**: Be mindful of gas costs, especially when utilizing interchain features that may involve multiple transactions.

4. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**: Many interchain operations are asynchronous; design your contract architecture to handle callbacks and timeouts gracefully.

5. **Implement Security Checks**: Always validate input data, especially from external sources like interchain queries.

  <strong>Developer Tip:</strong> Neutron's architecture is optimized for cross-chain DeFi applications. When designing your application, think about which chains you need to interact with and which Neutron modules best support those interactions.
