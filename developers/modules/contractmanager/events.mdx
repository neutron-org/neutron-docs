The Contract Manager module emits several events that can be observed during operations. These events are useful for debugging, monitoring, and tracking failures.

## Contract Failure Events

### `contract_failure`

Emitted when a contract's sudo handler fails and the failure is recorded in the Contract Manager.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | Address of the contract that experienced the failure |
| `failure_id` | Sequential ID of the failure for the specific contract |
| `redacted_error` | Redacted version of the error (codespace and code only) |
| `full_error` | Full, non-redacted error description |

```json
{
  "type": "contract_failure",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "contract_address",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "failure_id",
      "value": "1"
    },
    {
      "key": "redacted_error",
      "value": "codespace: wasm, code: 5"
    },
    {
      "key": "full_error",
      "value": "dispatch: submessages: Generic error: failed to process acknowledgment"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `out_of_gas_failure`

Emitted when a contract's sudo handler exceeds the gas limit.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | Address of the contract that experienced the out-of-gas error |
| `failure_id` | Sequential ID of the failure for the specific contract |
| `gas_limit` | Gas limit that was exceeded |
| `gas_used` | Approximate gas used before failure |

```json
{
  "type": "out_of_gas_failure",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "contract_address",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "failure_id",
      "value": "2"
    },
    {
      "key": "gas_limit",
      "value": "1000000"
    },
    {
      "key": "gas_used",
      "value": "1000001"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Resubmission Events

### `resubmit_failure`

Emitted when a failure is resubmitted for processing.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | Address of the contract resubmitting the failure |
| `failure_id` | ID of the failure being resubmitted |

```json
{
  "type": "resubmit_failure",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "contract_address",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "failure_id",
      "value": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `resubmit_failure_success`

Emitted when a resubmitted failure is successfully processed.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | Address of the contract that resubmitted the failure |
| `failure_id` | ID of the failure that was successfully resubmitted |

```json
{
  "type": "resubmit_failure_success",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "contract_address",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "failure_id",
      "value": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `resubmit_failure_error`

Emitted when a resubmitted failure fails again.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | Address of the contract that resubmitted the failure |
| `failure_id` | ID of the failure that failed again |
| `error` | The error that occurred during resubmission |

```json
{
  "type": "resubmit_failure_error",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "contract_address",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "failure_id",
      "value": "1"
    },
    {
      "key": "error",
      "value": "dispatch: submessages: Generic error: failed to process acknowledgment"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Module Parameter Events

### `param_change`

Emitted when the module parameters are updated.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `module` | Name of the module ("contractmanager") |
| `sudo_call_gas_limit` | New value for the sudo call gas limit |

```json
{
  "type": "param_change",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "module",
      "value": "contractmanager"
    },
    {
      "key": "sudo_call_gas_limit",
      "value": "1500000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Filtering Events

To filter for Contract Manager events using Tendermint's event query syntax:

```
tm.event='Tx' AND contract_failure.contract_address='neutron1...'
```

Or to capture all contract failures:

```
tm.event='Tx' AND message.module='contractmanager'
```

## Events in Block Results

Contract Manager events are also included in block results, which can be queried from the Tendermint RPC endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:26657/block_results?height=<height>
```

This is especially useful for monitoring applications that need to track contract failures.
