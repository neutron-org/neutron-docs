title: "State"
---

The Contract Manager module maintains state information to track contract failures and module parameters.

## State Objects

### Failure

The primary state object is the `Failure` record, which stores information about failed sudo calls:

```protobuf
message Failure {
  // Address of the failed contract
  string address = 1;
  // Id of the failure under specific address
  uint64 id = 2;
  // Serialized MessageSudoCallback with Packet and Ack(if exists)
  bytes sudo_payload = 3;
  // Redacted error response of the sudo call. Full error is emitted as an event
  string error = 4;
}
```

Each Failure record contains:
- `address`: The contract address that experienced the failure
- `id`: A sequential identifier specific to the contract address
- `sudo_payload`: The serialized message data that was passed to the sudo handler
- `error`: A redacted error message containing the codespace and code

### Module Parameters

The module parameters are stored as a `Params` object:

```protobuf
message Params {
  uint64 sudo_call_gas_limit = 1;
}
```

This contains:
- `sudo_call_gas_limit`: Maximum gas that can be used during a sudo call to a contract

## State Structure

The Contract Manager uses a simple key-value store system to manage its state:

```
ContractFailuresKey (0x01) + address + "/" + id → Failure
ParamsKey (0x02) → Params
```

### Prefixes

The module uses the following key prefixes in the KVStore:

| Prefix | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ContractFailuresKey` | `0x01` | Prefix for storing contract failures |
| `ParamsKey` | `0x02` | Prefix for storing module parameters |

### Failures Storage

The failures are stored using a composite key structure:

```
0x01 + address + "/" + id → Failure
```

This allows efficient retrieval of:
- All failures across all contracts
- All failures for a specific contract address
- A specific failure by address and ID

When a contract experiences a failure, a new record is created with an incremented ID for that contract address.

### Parameters Storage

The module parameters are stored under a single key:

```
0x02 → Params
```

## Genesis State

The genesis state of the Contract Manager module consists of:

```protobuf
message GenesisState {
  Params params = 1;
  repeated Failure failures_list = 2;
}
```

This includes:
- The module parameters
- A list of failures that existed at genesis or export time

## State Transitions

### Adding a Contract Failure

When a contract's sudo handler fails, the following occurs:

1. The module retrieves the highest failure ID for the contract address
2. It increments the ID to create a new unique identifier
3. It creates a new `Failure` record with:
   - The contract address
   - The new ID
   - The serialized sudo payload
   - A redacted version of the error
4. It stores the new failure under the appropriate key
5. It emits events with both the redacted and full error information

### Resubmitting a Failure

When a failure is resubmitted:

1. The module retrieves the failure record
2. It verifies that the sender is the same contract that experienced the failure
3. It deserializes the sudo payload
4. It executes the sudo call again without gas limitations
5. If successful:
   - It emits a success event
   - The failure record remains in state for reference
6. If unsuccessful:
   - It emits a failure event with the new error
   - The failure record remains unchanged

### Updating Parameters

When the module parameters are updated:

1. The module validates that the sender has the appropriate authority (governance)
2. It updates the params in state
3. It emits a parameter change event

## State Queries

The module provides several query methods to access its state:

1. `Params`: Retrieves the current module parameters
2. `AddressFailure`: Retrieves a specific failure by address and ID
3. `AddressFailures`: Retrieves all failures for a specific contract address
4. `Failures`: Retrieves all failures across all contracts

These queries support pagination for large result sets.
