This document provides detailed reference information for developers working with the Contract Manager module.

## Module Parameters

The Contract Manager module has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sudo_call_gas_limit` | uint64 | Maximum gas that can be used during a sudo call to a contract |

## Data Structures

### Failure

The `Failure` struct is the core data structure used to store information about failed sudo calls.

```protobuf
message Failure {
  // Address of the failed contract
  string address = 1;
  // Id of the failure under specific address
  uint64 id = 2;
  // Serialized MessageSudoCallback with Packet and Ack(if exists)
  bytes sudo_payload = 3;
  // Redacted error response of the sudo call. Full error is emitted as an event
  string error = 4;
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `address` | The contract address that experienced the failure |
| `id` | Sequential identifier for failures specific to the contract |
| `sudo_payload` | Serialized message callback data that was sent to the sudo handler |
| `error` | Redacted error message (contains codespace and code) |

## Key Space

The Contract Manager module uses the following key prefixes in the KVStore:

| Prefix | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `0x01` | Contract Failures |
| `0x02` | Module Parameters |

### Failure Key Structure

Failure records are indexed by:
- Contract address
- Sequential failure ID

The keys are structured as:
```
ContractFailuresKey + address + "/" + id
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1101 | `ErrIncorrectFailureToResubmit` | The failure ID does not exist or belongs to a different contract |
| 1102 | `ErrFailedToResubmitFailure` | Error occurred during failure resubmission |
| 1103 | `ErrSudoOutOfGas` | Sudo handling exceeded the gas limit allowed by the module |
| 1104 | `ErrNotContractResubmission` | Only smart contracts can resubmit failures |

## IBC Middleware

The Contract Manager provides middleware that wraps the Wasm module's sudo functionality. The middleware is defined by:

```go
type SudoLimitWrapper struct {
  Keeper            keeper.Keeper
  ContractManagerIK ContractManagerKeeper
  WasmKeeper        WasmKeeper
}
```

The wrapper implements the `WasmKeeper` interface:

```go
type WasmKeeper interface {
  HasContractInfo(ctx sdk.Context, contractAddress sdk.AccAddress) bool
  Sudo(ctx sdk.Context, contractAddress sdk.AccAddress, msg []byte) ([]byte, error)
}
```

## CosmWasm Bindings

### Messages

#### ResubmitFailure

Allows contracts to resubmit a failed operation:

```rust
pub enum NeutronMsg {
    ResubmitFailure {
        failure_id: u64,
    },
    // other messages...
}
```

This message can only be called by the contract that originally experienced the failure.

### Queries

#### ContractManagerFailures

Query failures for a specific contract:

```rust
pub enum NeutronQuery {
    ContractManagerFailures {
        address: String,
        pagination: Option<PageRequest>,
    },
    // other queries...
}
```

Response structure:

```rust
pub struct FailuresResponse {
    pub failures: Vec<Failure>,
    pub pagination: Option<PageResponse>,
}

pub struct Failure {
    pub address: String,
    pub id: u64,
    pub sudo_payload: Binary,
    pub error: String,
}
```

## Permissions

The Contract Manager module enforces strict permissions:

1. Only the original contract can resubmit its own failures
2. Only modules with proper authority can register failures (typically IBC modules)
3. Query operations are unrestricted

## Gas Considerations

It's important to understand gas usage in the Contract Manager context:

1. Sudo calls are limited to `sudo_call_gas_limit` gas
2. Resubmitted operations do not have this gas limit
3. Gas used for storing failures is charged to the transaction that triggered the sudo call
4. Querying failures uses standard query gas
