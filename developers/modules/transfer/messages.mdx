title: "Messages"
---

The Transfer module exposes messages for sending tokens between IBC-connected chains and for updating module parameters.

## MsgTransfer

`MsgTransfer` initiates a token transfer from Neutron to another chain.

```protobuf
message MsgTransfer {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "sender";

  // the port on which the packet will be sent
  string source_port = 1;
  // the channel by which the packet will be sent
  string source_channel = 2;
  // the tokens to be transferred
  cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin token = 3;
  // the sender address
  string sender = 4;
  // the recipient address on the destination chain
  string receiver = 5;
  // Timeout height relative to the current block height.
  // The timeout is disabled when set to 0.
  ibc.core.client.v1.Height timeout_height = 6;
  // Timeout timestamp in absolute nanoseconds since unix epoch.
  // The timeout is disabled when set to 0.
  uint64 timeout_timestamp = 7;
  // optional memo
  string memo = 8;
  // fees for IBC packet processing
  neutron.feerefunder.Fee fee = 9;
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source_port` | string | Port identifier on Neutron ("transfer") |
| `source_channel` | string | Channel identifier on Neutron (e.g., "channel-1") |
| `token` | Coin | Token to transfer with denom and amount |
| `sender` | string | Address of the sender on Neutron |
| `receiver` | string | Address of the recipient on the destination chain |
| `timeout_height` | Height | Block height on the destination chain after which the packet times out |
| `timeout_timestamp` | uint64 | Timestamp after which the packet times out (nanoseconds) |
| `memo` | string | Optional memo to include with the transfer |
| `fee` | Fee | IBC packet fees with different components |

### Fee Structure

The `fee` field has the following structure:

```protobuf
message Fee {
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin recv_fee = 1;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin ack_fee = 2;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin timeout_fee = 3;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recv_fee` | []Coin | Fee paid to the relayer for delivering the packet to the destination chain |
| `ack_fee` | []Coin | Fee paid to the relayer for delivering the acknowledgement back to Neutron |
| `timeout_fee` | []Coin | Fee paid to the relayer for delivering a timeout packet if the transfer times out |

### Response

Neutron's Transfer module provides an extended response that includes tracking information:

```protobuf
message MsgTransferResponse {
  // channel's sequence_id for outgoing ibc packet. Unique per a channel.
  uint64 sequence_id = 1;
  // channel src channel on neutron side transaction was submitted from
  string channel = 2;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sequence_id` | uint64 | Sequence number of the outgoing IBC packet |
| `channel` | string | Source channel ID on Neutron's side |

### Processing

When a `MsgTransfer` is processed:

1. The module validates the provided parameters (token, channel, sender, timeout, fees)
2. It prepares an IBC packet with the transfer data
3. It sends the packet to the IBC core module
4. It returns the sequence ID and channel of the outgoing packet

## MsgUpdateParams

`MsgUpdateParams` updates the module parameters. This message can only be executed by the governance account.

```protobuf
message MsgUpdateParams {
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "signer";

  // signer address
  string signer = 1;
  // params defines the transfer parameters to update.
  ibc.applications.transfer.v1.Params params = 2;
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signer` | string | The address of the governance account |
| `params` | Params | The new parameters to set |

### Params Structure

```protobuf
message Params {
  // send_enabled enables or disables all cross-chain token transfers from this chain.
  bool send_enabled = 1;
  // receive_enabled enables or disables all cross-chain token transfers to this chain.
  bool receive_enabled = 2;
}
```

### Response

```protobuf
message MsgUpdateParamsResponse {}
```

### Processing

When a `MsgUpdateParams` is processed:

1. The module verifies that the signer is the authorized governance account
2. It updates the module parameters in state
3. It returns an empty response

## Sudo Call Interface

The Transfer module also uses a Sudo call interface to communicate with sending contracts when acknowledgements or timeouts are received for IBC packets. These are not directly invokable messages but part of the module's internal processing.

### Success Response

```json
{
  "response": {
    "request_id": "channel-1-42",
    "data": "base64encodeddata"
  }
}
```

The `request_id` follows the format `channel-{channelID}-{sequence}` to allow contracts to correlate callbacks with their original transfer requests.

The `data` field is a Base64-encoded JSON object containing the acknowledgement data.

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "request_id": "channel-1-42",
    "error": "error message"
  }
}
```

The `error` field contains information about what went wrong with the transfer on the destination chain.

### Timeout Response

```json
{
  "timeout": {
    "request_id": "channel-1-42"
  }
}
```

This indicates that the packet timed out before being processed by the destination chain.

## IBC Packet Data Format

When a transfer is sent through the Transfer module, the IBC packet contains data in the following format:

```protobuf
message FungibleTokenPacketData {
  // the token denomination to be transferred
  string denom = 1;
  // the token amount to be transferred
  string amount = 2;
  // the sender address
  string sender = 3;
  // the recipient address on the destination chain
  string receiver = 4;
  // optional memo
  string memo = 5;
}
```

This packet data is serialized and included in the IBC packet that is sent to the destination chain.
