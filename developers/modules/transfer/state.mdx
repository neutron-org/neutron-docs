# State

The Transfer module stores denomination trace information as well as escrow addresses for locked tokens.

## State Objects

### DenomTrace

DenomTrace defines the base denomination for IBC fungible tokens and the source tracing information path.

```proto
// DenomTrace contains the base denomination for IBC fungible tokens and the
// source tracing information path.
message DenomTrace {
  // path defines the chain of port/channel identifiers used for tracing the
  // source of the fungible token.
  string path = 1;
  // base denomination of the relayed fungible token.
  string base_denom = 2;
}
```

The `path` is a `/`-delimited string of the form: `portID/channelID/portID/channelID...` that represents the port and channel IDs that a token transfer passes through.

For example, if an IBC token starts on chain A with the denom `mytoken`, and passes through channels across chains B and C, the final denomination on chain C would be represented by a DenomTrace with:
- `path` = `transfer/channelAB/transfer/channelBC`
- `base_denom` = `mytoken`

This would result in an IBC denom that looks like: `ibc/{hash}` where `{hash}` is a hash of the path and base denom.

### FungibleTokenPacketData

FungibleTokenPacketData defines a struct for the fungible token packet data.

```proto
// FungibleTokenPacketData defines a struct for the packet payload
message FungibleTokenPacketData {
  // the token denomination to be transferred
  string denom = 1;
  // the token amount to be transferred
  string amount = 2;
  // the sender address
  string sender = 3;
  // the recipient address on the destination chain
  string receiver = 4;
  // optional memo information
  string memo = 5;
}
```

## State Transitions

The IBC transfer module primarily modifies state through the following operations:

1. **Sending Tokens**: When tokens are sent to another chain, they are escrowed (locked) in a module account on the sending chain.
2. **Receiving Tokens**: When tokens are received from another chain, they are either:
   - Released from escrow (if they originated from this chain)
   - Minted as new IBC voucher tokens (if they originated from a different chain)

## KVStore

The Transfer module uses the following prefixes for KVStore keys:

| Prefix | Key Format | Value | Notes |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| `0x00` | `0x00 \| []byte(trace hash)` | `DenomTrace` | Store denom trace for a given hash |
| `0x01` | `0x01` | `[]DenomTrace` | Store all denom traces for iteration |
| `0x02` | `0x02 \| []byte(port + channel)` | `bool` | Store IBC send disable status for a given channel |
| `0x03` | `0x03 \| []byte(port + channel)` | `bool` | Store IBC receive disable status for a given channel |

The Transfer module's KVStore is accessed with the storeKey `ibc-transfer`.

## Genesis State

The Genesis state of the Transfer module contains:

```proto
// GenesisState defines the ibc-transfer genesis state
message GenesisState {
  string port_id = 1;
  // the sequence for the next generated channel identifier
  repeated DenomTrace denom_traces = 2;
  Params params = 3;
}

// Params defines the set of IBC transfer parameters
message Params {
  // send_enabled enables or disables all cross-chain token transfers from this chain
  bool send_enabled = 1;
  // receive_enabled enables or disables all cross-chain token transfers to this chain
  bool receive_enabled = 2;
}
```

The main parameters stored in the genesis state are:
- `port_id`: The IBC port identifier used by the transfer module (typically "transfer")
- `denom_traces`: A list of all denomination traces known by the module
- `params`: Module parameters that control enabling/disabling of IBC transfers
