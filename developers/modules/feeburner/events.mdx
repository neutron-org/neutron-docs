The Fee Burner module emits several events that can be observed during operations. These events are useful for monitoring fee burning and treasury transfers.

## Module Events

### `fee_burn`

Emitted when NTRN tokens are burned by the module.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `module` | Name of the module ("feeburner") |
| `amount` | Amount and denomination of NTRN tokens burned |
| `total_burned` | Total amount of NTRN tokens burned since genesis after this operation |

```json
{
  "type": "fee_burn",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "module",
      "value": "feeburner"
    },
    {
      "key": "amount",
      "value": "5000untrn"
    },
    {
      "key": "total_burned",
      "value": "1532692456789untrn"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `treasury_transfer`

Emitted when non-NTRN tokens are transferred to the Treasury.

| Attribute Key | Description |

      "value": "feeburner"
    },
    {
      "key": "amount",
      "value": "100000uatom,50000uosmo"

}
```

### `param_change`

Emitted when the module parameters are updated.

| Attribute Key | Description |

| `module` | Name of the module ("feeburner") |
| `neutron_denom` | New value for the Neutron token denomination |
| `treasury_address` | New value for the Treasury address |

```json
{
  "type": "param_change",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "module",
      "value": "feeburner"
    },
    {
      "key": "neutron_denom",
      "value": "untrn"
    },
    {
      "key": "treasury_address",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    }
  ]

## Bank Module Events

In addition to its own events, the Fee Burner module triggers standard Bank module events during its operations:

### `burn`

Emitted by the Bank module when coins are burned.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `burner` | Address of the module burning the tokens ("cons_redistribute") |
| `amount` | Amount and denomination of tokens burned |

```json
{
  "type": "burn",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "burner",
      "value": "neutron1..." // cons_redistribute module address
    },
    {
      "key": "amount",
      "value": "5000untrn"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `transfer`

Emitted by the Bank module when tokens are transferred to the Treasury.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sender` | Address of the module sending the tokens ("cons_redistribute") |
| `recipient` | Address of the Treasury |
| `amount` | Amount and denomination of tokens transferred |

```json
{
  "type": "transfer",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "sender",
      "value": "neutron1..." // cons_redistribute module address
    },
    {
      "key": "recipient",
      "value": "neutron1..." // Treasury address
    },
    {
      "key": "amount",
      "value": "100000uatom,50000uosmo"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Filtering Events

To filter for Fee Burner module events using Tendermint's event query syntax:

```
tm.event='Tx' AND fee_burn.module='feeburner'
```

Or to capture all events related to the Fee Burner module:

```
tm.event='Tx' AND message.module='feeburner'
```

## Events in Block Results

Fee Burner events are also included in block results, which can be queried from the Tendermint RPC endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:26657/block_results?height=<height>
```

This is useful for monitoring applications that track burning rates or Treasury transfers.
