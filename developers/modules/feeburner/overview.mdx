title: "Fee Burner Overview"
---

The Fee Burner module is a core component of Neutron's tokenomics design. It manages the consumer part of transaction fees by implementing a deflationary mechanism that burns NTRN tokens and redistributes other token denominations to the Treasury.

## Key Features

- **NTRN Token Burning**: Automatically burns all fees collected in NTRN tokens, creating deflationary pressure on the token supply
  
- **Treasury Redistribution**: Directs non-NTRN fee tokens to the Treasury address for ecosystem funding

- **Automatic Execution**: Runs at the end of each block to process accumulated fees

- **Accounting**: Tracks the total amount of NTRN tokens burned over time

## Module Functionality

The Fee Burner module operates through the following workflow:

1. **Fee Collection**: Interchain Security collects transaction fees and splits them between the provider chain (25%) and consumer chain (75%)
   
2. **Fee Processing**: At the end of each block, the module processes all fees in the redistribution account:
   - NTRN tokens are burned, permanently removing them from circulation
   - Non-NTRN tokens are sent to the Treasury address for further ecosystem management

3. **Record Keeping**: The module maintains a state record of the total amount of NTRN tokens burned since genesis

This mechanism ensures a sustainable tokenomics model by creating continuous deflationary pressure on the NTRN token while providing funding for ecosystem development through the Treasury.
