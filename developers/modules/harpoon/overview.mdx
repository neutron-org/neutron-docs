# Overview

This document explains the `harpoon` module for the Neutron network.

Harpoon allows CosmWasm smart contracts to subscribe to staking module hooks. Its primary purpose is to enable the calculation of historical voting power from the staking module, which is essential for governance systems that rely on historical data. The module can also be used for other staking-related functionality in smart contracts.

## Concepts

The Harpoon module acts as a bridge between the staking module's hooks and CosmWasm smart contracts. When staking-related events occur (such as delegations, unbondings, or validator changes), the module notifies subscribed contracts, allowing them to react accordingly.

### Why Harpoon is Needed

Standard CosmWasm contracts cannot directly query historical staking data. While contracts can query current staking information, they cannot access data from previous block heights. This limitation is particularly problematic for governance systems that need to determine voting power at the time a proposal was created.

Harpoon solves this by allowing contracts to subscribe to staking events and maintain their own historical records, enabling accurate historical voting power calculations and other time-sensitive staking operations.

### Subscription Mechanism

Subscriptions to staking hooks can only be created through governance proposals. This restriction ensures that only thoroughly vetted contracts can receive these notifications, preventing potential spam or security issues.

### Available Hooks

Harpoon supports all the hooks provided by the Cosmos SDK staking module, including:

- Validator creation, modification, and removal events
- Validator bonding and unbonding events
- Delegation creation, modification, and removal events
- Slashing events
- Unbonding initiation events

## Hook Execution

When a staking event occurs, the Harpoon module executes a `sudo` call on each subscribed contract. These calls are performed in the same context as the original operation, meaning:

- Hooks triggered by transactions can abort those transactions if the contract returns an error
- Hooks triggered by end-blockers can potentially halt the chain if the contract returns an error

For this reason, contracts that subscribe to Harpoon hooks must be carefully designed to handle all possible scenarios without errors.
