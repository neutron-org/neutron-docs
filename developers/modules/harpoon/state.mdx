# State

The Harpoon module maintains a simple but efficient state structure to track which contracts are subscribed to specific hook types.

## Storage Layout

The module's primary storage consists of mapping each hook type to a list of contract addresses that are subscribed to it.

### Subscription Storage

```
KEY: []byte("subscriptions") + BigEndian(uint32(hookType))
VALUE: HookSubscriptions (serialized)
```

Where `HookSubscriptions` is a structure containing an array of contract addresses:

```protobuf
message HookSubscriptions {
  repeated string contract_addresses = 1;
}
```

This storage layout is optimized for the most common operation: retrieving all contracts that need to be notified when a specific hook is triggered.

## State Transitions

### Adding a Subscription

When a contract is subscribed to a hook type through governance:

1. The module retrieves the current list of subscribed contracts for the hook type
2. If the contract is not already in the list, it adds the contract address
3. The updated list is stored back in the state

### Removing a Subscription

When a contract is unsubscribed from a hook type:

1. The module retrieves the current list of subscribed contracts for the hook type
2. It removes the contract address from the list
3. The updated list is stored back in the state
4. If the list becomes empty, the key-value pair is deleted from the store

### Updating Subscriptions

The `ManageHookSubscription` message allows updating all hook subscriptions for a contract in a single operation:

1. The module iterates through all possible hook types
2. For each hook type, it checks if the contract is currently subscribed
3. If the hook type is in the new subscription list but the contract is not subscribed, it adds the subscription
4. If the hook type is not in the new subscription list but the contract is subscribed, it removes the subscription

## Genesis State

The genesis state of the Harpoon module contains all hook subscriptions that should exist when the chain starts:

```protobuf
// GenesisState represents the current harpoon module's genesis state.
message GenesisState {
  // All hook subscriptions by contract_address and hook_type, currently in the store.
  repeated HookSubscription hook_subscriptions = 1;
}

// Specifies hook subscriptions for the contract_address.
message HookSubscription {
  string contract_address = 2;
  repeated HookType hooks = 3;
}
```

When initializing the chain from genesis, the module iterates through all hook subscriptions and adds them to the state.

## State Invariants

The Harpoon module maintains several invariants in its state:

1. Each contract address can appear at most once in the subscription list for each hook type
2. Invalid hook types (HOOK_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED) cannot be stored
3. Contract addresses must be valid bech32 addresses

These invariants are enforced whenever the state is modified through governance proposals.
