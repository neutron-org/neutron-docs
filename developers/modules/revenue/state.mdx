title: "State"
---

The Revenue module maintains several state objects in the store that track validator performance, payment schedules, and price data.

## State Objects

### PaymentSchedule

The payment schedule defines when validator compensation is distributed. There is only one payment schedule active at any time.

```go
// PaymentScheduleKeyPrefix + 0x01 -> PaymentSchedule
PaymentScheduleKey = []byte{0x01}
```

```protobuf
message PaymentSchedule {
  PaymentScheduleType type = 1;
  uint64 periods_passed = 2;
  uint64 periods_count = 3;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp month_end_time = 4 [(gogoproto.stdtime) = true, (gogoproto.nullable) = true];
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | PaymentScheduleType | The type of schedule: Monthly, Block-based, or Empty |
| `periods_passed` | uint64 | The number of periods that have passed since inception |
| `periods_count` | uint64 | For block-based schedules, the number of blocks to count before distributing rewards |
| `month_end_time` | Timestamp | For monthly schedules, the timestamp of the end of the current month |

The payment schedule type is determined by the module parameters, but the actual payment schedule state tracks the progress of periods and is updated automatically by the module.

### ValidatorInfo

The module tracks performance metrics for each active validator. Each validator has a separate state entry.

```go
// ValidatorInfoKeyPrefix + validatorAddress -> ValidatorInfo
ValidatorInfoKeyPrefix = []byte{0x02}
```

```protobuf
message ValidatorInfo {
  string address = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  uint64 signed_blocks = 2;
  uint64 blocks_in_window = 3;
  uint64 provided_oracle_votes = 4;
  uint64 oracle_votes_in_window = 5;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `address` | string | The validator's operator address |
| `signed_blocks` | uint64 | The number of blocks the validator has signed in the current period |
| `blocks_in_window` | uint64 | The total number of blocks in the current period |
| `provided_oracle_votes` | uint64 | The number of oracle votes the validator has provided in the current period |
| `oracle_votes_in_window` | uint64 | The total number of oracle votes possible in the current period |

This information resets at the end of each payment period and is used to calculate the performance rating for reward distribution.

### RewardAssetPrice

The module tracks historical price data for the reward asset to calculate the TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price).

```go
// RewardAssetPricePrefix + timestamp -> RewardAssetPrice
RewardAssetPricePrefix = []byte{0x03}
```

```protobuf
message RewardAssetPrice {
  string cumulative_price = 1 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Dec",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
  string absolute_price = 2 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types.Dec",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
  int64 timestamp = 3;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cumulative_price` | sdk.Dec | The cumulative price from the beginning of observations |
| `absolute_price` | sdk.Dec | The instantaneous asset price at the current timestamp |
| `timestamp` | int64 | The timestamp of this price observation |

The module stores multiple price observations within the TWAP window and uses them to calculate the time-weighted average price when determining payment amounts.

## State Transitions

### PreBlock Hook

Most state transitions occur in the module's PreBlock hook, which is executed at the beginning of each block:

1. **Price Calculation**: The module fetches the current price of the reward asset from the Oracle module and stores a new RewardAssetPrice entry. It also removes outdated price entries (older than the TWAP window).

2. **Performance Recording**: The module records validator participation in block production and oracle votes by parsing the ExtendedVoteInfo from the block. It updates each validator's ValidatorInfo record accordingly.

3. **Payment Period Check**: The module checks if the current payment period has ended. If it has:
   - Calculates performance ratings for all validators
   - Distributes rewards based on these ratings
   - Resets all ValidatorInfo records for the next period
   - Updates the PaymentSchedule state to start a new period

4. **Payment Schedule Type Check**: The module checks if the payment schedule type in the parameters has changed. If it has, it updates the PaymentSchedule state to match the new type.

### MsgUpdateParams

When parameters are updated via governance, this can affect the payment schedule. The module's state is updated to reflect any changes to the payment schedule type.

### MsgFundTreasury

When the treasury is funded, no direct state changes occur in the Revenue module's store. Instead, the funds are transferred to the module account, which is tracked by the Auth module.

## Queries

The following queries allow retrieving state information:

- `QueryParams`: Returns the current module parameters
- `QueryValidatorInfo`: Returns the performance metrics for a specific validator
- `QueryPaymentSchedule`: Returns the current payment schedule information
