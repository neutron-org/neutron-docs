title: "Events"
---

The Fee Refunder module emits several events that can be observed during operations. These events are useful for tracking fee locking, distribution, and monitoring system behavior.

## Module Events

### `lock_fees`

Emitted when fees are locked for an IBC packet.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `payer` | Address of the account that paid the fees |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

Example event:
```json
{
  "type": "lock_fees",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "payer",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "port_id",
      "value": "transfer"
    },
    {
      "key": "channel_id",
      "value": "channel-0"
    },
    {
      "key": "sequence",
      "value": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `distribute_acknowledgement_fee`

Emitted when an acknowledgement fee is distributed to a relayer.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `receiver` | Address of the relayer receiving the acknowledgement fee |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

Example event:
```json
{
  "type": "distribute_acknowledgement_fee",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "receiver",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "port_id",
      "value": "transfer"
    },
    {
      "key": "channel_id",
      "value": "channel-0"
    },
    {
      "key": "sequence",
      "value": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `distribute_timeout_fee`

Emitted when a timeout fee is distributed to a relayer.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `receiver` | Address of the relayer receiving the timeout fee |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

Example event:
```json
{
  "type": "distribute_timeout_fee",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "receiver",
      "value": "neutron1..."
    },
    {
      "key": "port_id",
      "value": "transfer"
    },
    {
      "key": "channel_id",
      "value": "channel-0"
    },
    {
      "key": "sequence",
      "value": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Generic System Events

In addition to the module-specific events, standard Cosmos SDK events are emitted during fee operations:

### `message`

Emitted on all operations with module attribution.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `module` | Name of the module ("feerefunder") |

Example event:
```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "module",
      "value": "feerefunder"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `transfer`

Emitted by the Bank module when fees are transferred.

When locking fees:

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sender` | Address of the fee payer |
| `recipient` | Module account of the Fee Refunder |
| `amount` | Total fee amount (ack_fee + timeout_fee) |

When distributing fees:

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sender` | Module account of the Fee Refunder |
| `recipient` | Address of the relayer or original payer |
| `amount` | Amount of fee being distributed |

Example event when locking fees:
```json
{
  "type": "transfer",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "sender",
      "value": "neutron1..." // Payer address
    },
    {
      "key": "recipient",
      "value": "neutron1..." // Fee Refunder module account
    },
    {
      "key": "amount",
      "value": "2000untrn" // Total fee amount
    }
  ]
}
```

Example event when distributing fees:
```json
{
  "type": "transfer",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "key": "sender",
      "value": "neutron1..." // Fee Refunder module account
    },
    {
      "key": "recipient",
      "value": "neutron1..." // Relayer address
    },
    {
      "key": "amount",
      "value": "1000untrn" // Acknowledgement fee
    }
  ]
}
```

## Filtering Events

To filter for Fee Refunder module events using Tendermint's event query syntax:

### Filter for Fee Locking Events

```
tm.event='Tx' AND lock_fees.payer='neutron1...'
```

### Filter for Acknowledgement Fee Distribution Events

```
tm.event='Tx' AND distribute_acknowledgement_fee.receiver='neutron1...'
```

### Filter for Timeout Fee Distribution Events

```
tm.event='Tx' AND distribute_timeout_fee.receiver='neutron1...'
```

### Filter for All Fee Refunder Module Events

```
tm.event='Tx' AND message.module='feerefunder'
```

## Events in Block Results

Fee Refunder events are also included in block results, which can be queried from the Tendermint RPC endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:26657/block_results?height=<height>
```

This is useful for monitoring applications tracking fee operations across the blockchain.

## Monitoring Event Sequences

For a complete fee lifecycle, you would typically observe the following event sequence:

1. `lock_fees` - When an IBC packet is sent with fees
2. Either:
   - `distribute_acknowledgement_fee` - When an acknowledgement is received
   - `distribute_timeout_fee` - When a timeout is received

Each event will be accompanied by the corresponding `transfer` events from the Bank module.
