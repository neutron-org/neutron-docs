This document provides detailed reference information for developers working with the Fee Refunder module.

## Module Parameters

The Fee Refunder module has the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `min_fee` | Fee | Minimum required fees for IBC packet acknowledgements and timeouts |

The `min_fee` parameter structure:

```protobuf
message Fee {
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin recv_fee = 1;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin ack_fee = 2;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin timeout_fee = 3;
}
```

## Data Structures

### Fee

The `Fee` struct defines fees required for each type of IBC packet operation:

```protobuf
message Fee {
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin recv_fee = 1;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin ack_fee = 2;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin timeout_fee = 3;
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `recv_fee` | Fees paid to relayers for delivering receive packets (must be zero in Neutron) |
| `ack_fee` | Fees paid to relayers for delivering acknowledgement packets |
| `timeout_fee` | Fees paid to relayers for delivering timeout packets |

### PacketID

The `PacketID` struct uniquely identifies an IBC packet:

```protobuf
message PacketID {
  string channel_id = 1;
  string port_id = 2;
  uint64 sequence = 3;
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

### FeeInfo

The `FeeInfo` struct stores fee information for a specific packet:

```protobuf
message FeeInfo {
  string payer = 1;
  Fee fee = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  PacketID packet_id = 3 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `payer` | Address of the account that paid the fees |
| `fee` | Fee information including ack and timeout fees |
| `packet_id` | Identifier of the IBC packet |

## Key Space

The Fee Refunder module uses the following keys in the KVStore:

| Prefix | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `0x01` + `portID/channelID/sequence` | Stores fee information for specific IBC packets |
| `0x02` | Stores module parameters |

## Keeper Functions

### LockFees

```go
func (k Keeper) LockFees(ctx context.Context, payer sdk.AccAddress, packetID types.PacketID, fee types.Fee) error
```

Locks fees for a specific IBC packet. This function:
- Validates that the provided fees meet minimum requirements
- Stores fee information for the packet
- Transfers fees from the payer to the module account

### DistributeAcknowledgementFee

```go
func (k Keeper) DistributeAcknowledgementFee(ctx context.Context, receiver sdk.AccAddress, packetID types.PacketID)
```

Distributes fees when an acknowledgement is received:
- Pays the acknowledgement fee to the relayer
- Returns the timeout fee to the original payer
- Removes the fee information from storage

### DistributeTimeoutFee

```go
func (k Keeper) DistributeTimeoutFee(ctx context.Context, receiver sdk.AccAddress, packetID types.PacketID)
```

Distributes fees when a timeout is received:
- Pays the timeout fee to the relayer
- Returns the acknowledgement fee to the original payer
- Removes the fee information from storage

### GetFeeInfo

```go
func (k Keeper) GetFeeInfo(ctx sdk.Context, packetID types.PacketID) (*types.FeeInfo, error)
```

Retrieves fee information for a specific packet.

### GetAllFeeInfos

```go
func (k Keeper) GetAllFeeInfos(ctx sdk.Context) []types.FeeInfo
```

Returns all fee information entries stored in the module.

### GetMinFee

```go
func (k Keeper) GetMinFee(ctx sdk.Context) types.Fee
```

Returns the minimum required fees from module parameters.

## Query Service

The Fee Refunder module exposes the following query endpoints:

### MinFee

`MinFee` queries the minimum required fees.

Request:
```protobuf
message QueryMinFeeRequest {}
```

Response:
```protobuf
message QueryMinFeeResponse {
  Fee min_fee = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

### Params

`Params` queries the module parameters.

Request:
```protobuf
message QueryParamsRequest {}
```

Response:
```protobuf
message QueryParamsResponse {
  Params params = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

### FeeInfo

`FeeInfo` queries fee information for a specific packet.

Request:
```protobuf
message QueryFeeInfoRequest {
  string port_id = 1;
  string channel_id = 2;
  uint64 sequence = 3;
}
```

Response:
```protobuf
message QueryFeeInfoResponse {
  FeeInfo fee_info = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

### AllFeeInfo

`AllFeeInfo` queries all fee information entries.

Request:
```protobuf
message QueryAllFeeInfoRequest {}
```

Response:
```protobuf
message QueryAllFeeInfoResponse {
  repeated FeeInfo fee_infos = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}
```

## Events

The Fee Refunder module emits the following events:

### `lock_fees`

Emitted when fees are locked for a packet.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `payer` | Address of the account that paid the fees |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

### `distribute_acknowledgement_fee`

Emitted when an acknowledgement fee is distributed.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `receiver` | Address receiving the acknowledgement fee (relayer) |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

### `distribute_timeout_fee`

Emitted when a timeout fee is distributed.

| Attribute Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `receiver` | Address receiving the timeout fee (relayer) |
| `port_id` | ID of the IBC port |
| `channel_id` | ID of the IBC channel |
| `sequence` | Sequence number of the packet |

## CLI Commands

### Queries

#### Query Module Parameters

```bash
neutrond query feerefunder params
```

Returns the current module parameters, including minimum required fees.

#### Query Minimum Fees

```bash
neutrond query feerefunder min-fee
```

Returns the minimum required fees for IBC operations.

#### Query Fee Information for a Packet

```bash
neutrond query feerefunder fee-info <port-id> <channel-id> <sequence>
```

Returns fee information for a specific IBC packet.

#### Query All Fee Information

```bash
neutrond query feerefunder all-fee-info
```

Returns all fee information entries stored in the module.

## Integration Points

The Fee Refunder module integrates with:

### IBC Transfer Module

When an IBC transfer is initiated with a `MsgTransfer` that includes a fee, the Fee Refunder module locks the fees and associates them with the generated packet.

### Interchain Transactions Module

When an interchain transaction is submitted with a `MsgSubmitTx` that includes a fee, the Fee Refunder module locks the fees and associates them with the generated packet.

### IBC Core

The Fee Refunder hooks into IBC acknowledgement and timeout packet processing to distribute fees to relayers.
