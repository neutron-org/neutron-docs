title: "State"
---

The Interchain Transactions module maintains state information about registered interchain accounts and their associated channels. This document describes the state objects and their storage schema.

## Genesis State

The module's genesis state contains the module parameters:

```go
// GenesisState defines the interchaintxs module's genesis state.
type GenesisState struct {
    // params defines all the parameters of the module.
    Params Params `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=params,proto3" json:"params"`
}
```

## Module Parameters

The module parameters are stored in the params subspace and include:

```go
// Params defines the parameters for the interchaintxs module.
type Params struct {
    // host_enabled defines whether the host submodule is enabled.
    HostEnabled bool `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=host_enabled,json=hostEnabled,proto3" json:"host_enabled,omitempty"`
    // allow_messages defines a list of sdk messages that the interchaintxs 
    // module can execute.
    AllowMessages []string `protobuf:"bytes,2,rep,name=allow_messages,json=allowMessages,proto3" json:"allow_messages,omitempty"`
}
```

The parameters control:
- Whether the host functionality is enabled (for receiving interchain accounts)
- Which message types are allowed to be executed on remote chains

## State Objects

The module maintains several key-value pairs in the store that track interchain accounts and their associated information.

### Port-to-Owner Mapping

Maps a port ID to the owner address and interchain account ID.

**Key Format:**
```
portID → {owner_address, interchain_account_id}
```

This mapping allows the module to quickly determine which contract and interchain account ID are associated with a particular IBC port.

### Channel-to-Port Mapping

Maps a channel ID to its associated port ID.

**Key Format:**
```
channelID → portID
```

This mapping enables the module to find the correct port ID when handling channel acknowledgements and timeouts based on channel ID.

### Owner-to-Interchain Account Address Mapping

Maps a combination of owner address, interchain account ID, and connection ID to the remote interchain account address.

**Key Format:**
```
{owner_address}|{interchain_account_id}|{connection_id} → remote_account_address
```

This mapping allows contracts to query the address of their interchain accounts on remote chains.

## State Transitions

The state undergoes transitions during the following operations:

### Interchain Account Registration

When a contract successfully registers an interchain account:

1. A new port and channel are created for the interchain account
2. The port-to-owner mapping is stored, linking the port to the contract and interchain account ID
3. The channel-to-port mapping is stored, linking the newly created channel to the port

### Channel Acknowledgement

When a channel open acknowledgement is received for an interchain account:

1. The remote interchain account address is extracted from the acknowledgement
2. The owner-to-interchain account address mapping is stored, allowing the contract to query the address

### Transaction Submission

When a contract submits a transaction for execution on a remote chain:

1. The port and channel for the specified interchain account ID are looked up
2. The transaction is sent through the appropriate IBC channel
3. No state changes occur in the module itself during this operation

### Module Parameter Updates

When governance updates the module parameters:

1. The new parameters are stored in the params subspace
2. No existing interchain accounts or channels are affected by parameter updates

## Querying State

The module provides query endpoints to access state information:

- `QueryInterchainAccountAddress`: Retrieves the remote address of an interchain account based on owner, interchain account ID, and connection ID
- `QueryParams`: Retrieves the current module parameters

These queries allow contracts and users to obtain information about registered interchain accounts without modifying state.
