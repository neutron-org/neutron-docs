The Interchain Transactions module enables CosmWasm smart contracts to interact with other blockchains in the IBC ecosystem by managing interchain accounts and executing transactions on remote zones. This module provides a critical bridge between smart contracts on Neutron and functionality on connected IBC-enabled chains.

## Key Features

</CardGroup>

## Usage Examples

- **Cross-Chain DeFi**: Enabling a Neutron-based protocol to participate in DeFi activities on other chains
- **Governance Participation**: Allowing Neutron contracts to vote in governance proposals on remote chains
- **Asset Management**: Managing tokens and NFTs held on connected chains through secure IBC channels
- **Multi-Chain Orchestration**: Creating complex workflows that span multiple blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem

## Module Interactions

The Interchain Transactions module extensively interacts with:

- **IBC Module**: For establishing connections and channels to remote chains
- **CosmWasm Module**: For executing contract callbacks on IBC events
- **Fee Refunder Module**: For handling packet fee payments and refunds
- **Contract Manager Module**: For managing gas limits and error handling during contract callbacks
