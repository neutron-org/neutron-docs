title: "Messages"
---

The Interchain Transactions module exposes several messages for registering interchain accounts, executing transactions on remote chains, and managing module parameters.

## MsgRegisterInterchainAccount

`MsgRegisterInterchainAccount` is used to register an account on a remote zone through an IBC connection.

```protobuf
message MsgRegisterInterchainAccount {
  string from_address = 1;
  string connection_id = 2;
  string interchain_account_id = 3;
  repeated cosmos.base.v1beta1.Coin register_fee = 4;
  ibc.core.channel.v1.Order ordering = 5;
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `from_address` | string | The address of the account initiating the registration (typically a contract address) |
| `connection_id` | string | The ID of the IBC connection to use for the interchain account |
| `interchain_account_id` | string | A unique identifier for the interchain account (used in the port ID) |
| `register_fee` | []Coin | Fee paid for registration (charged to the sender) |
| `ordering` | Order | The channel ordering to use (typically ORDERED for interchain accounts) |

### Example

```javascript
{
  "from_address": "neutron14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s5c2epq",
  "connection_id": "connection-0",
  "interchain_account_id": "myaccount",
  "register_fee": [
    {
      "denom": "untrn",
      "amount": "1000"
    }
  ],
  "ordering": 1  // ORDERED
}
```

### Response

```protobuf
message MsgRegisterInterchainAccountResponse {
  string channel_id = 1;
  string port_id = 2;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel_id` | string | The ID of the newly created IBC channel |
| `port_id` | string | The port ID associated with the interchain account |

### Processing

When `MsgRegisterInterchainAccount` is processed:

1. The module validates that the connection ID exists
2. It creates a unique port ID in the format `icacontroller-{from_address}.{interchain_account_id}`
3. It claims the port capability and initiates a channel opening handshake with the remote chain
4. The register fee is charged to the sender account
5. The channel and port information are returned immediately, but the actual interchain account is created when the channel is established
6. Once the channel is established, a callback is sent to the initiating contract with the channel information

## MsgSubmitTx

`MsgSubmitTx` submits a transaction for execution on a remote chain through an interchain account.

```protobuf
message MsgSubmitTx {
  string from_address = 1;
  string interchain_account_id = 2;
  string connection_id = 3;
  repeated google.protobuf.Any msgs = 4;
  string memo = 5;
  uint64 timeout = 6;
  neutron.feerefunder.Fee fee = 7;
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `from_address` | string | The address of the account submitting the transaction (typically a contract address) |
| `interchain_account_id` | string | The identifier of the interchain account to use |
| `connection_id` | string | The ID of the IBC connection to use |
| `msgs` | []Any | The messages to execute on the remote chain |
| `memo` | string | An optional memo to include with the transaction |
| `timeout` | uint64 | The timeout in seconds after which the packet times out |
| `fee` | Fee | The fees to pay for packet relaying |

### Example

```javascript
{
  "from_address": "neutron14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s5c2epq",
  "interchain_account_id": "myaccount",
  "connection_id": "connection-0",
  "msgs": [
    {
      "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
      "from_address": "cosmos1...",
      "to_address": "cosmos1...",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "uatom",
          "amount": "1000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "memo": "Send from Neutron",
  "timeout": 600,
  "fee": {
    "recv_fee": [
      {
        "denom": "untrn",
        "amount": "2000"
      }
    ],
    "ack_fee": [
      {
        "denom": "untrn",
        "amount": "1000"
      }
    ],
    "timeout_fee": [
      {
        "denom": "untrn",
        "amount": "1000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Response

```protobuf
message MsgSubmitTxResponse {
  uint64 sequence_id = 1;
  string channel = 2;
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sequence_id` | uint64 | The sequence ID of the outgoing IBC packet |
| `channel` | string | The source channel ID on the Neutron side |

### Processing

When `MsgSubmitTx` is processed:

1. The module validates that the interchain account exists and has an active channel
2. It validates that the fee is sufficient for packet relaying
3. It prepares an IBC packet containing the messages to execute
4. It registers the fee with the Fee Refunder module
5. It sends the packet through the appropriate IBC channel
6. It returns the sequence ID and channel immediately
7. The actual execution on the remote chain happens asynchronously
8. When the acknowledgement or timeout is received, a callback is sent to the initiating contract

## MsgUpdateParams

`MsgUpdateParams` updates the module parameters. This message can only be executed by the governance account.

```protobuf
message MsgUpdateParams {
  string authority = 1;
  Params params = 2;
}
```

### Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authority` | string | The address of the governance account |
| `params` | Params | The new parameters to set |

### Example

```javascript
{
  "authority": "neutron10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6z2zm3",
  "params": {
    "host_enabled": true,
    "allow_messages": [
      "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
      "/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgDelegate",
      "/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgUndelegate",
      "/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgBeginRedelegate",
      "/cosmos.distribution.v1beta1.MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward",
      "/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Response

```protobuf
message MsgUpdateParamsResponse {}
```

### Processing

When `MsgUpdateParams` is processed:

1. The module validates that the sender is the authorized governance account
2. It updates the module parameters in the params subspace
3. It returns an empty response

## IBC Callbacks

In addition to the state-changing messages above, the Interchain Transactions module also processes the following IBC callbacks internally:

### OnChanOpenAck

Called when a channel open handshake is completed. The module:

1. Extracts the interchain account address from the version string
2. Stores the interchain account address in state
3. Calls back to the initiating contract via Sudo

### OnAcknowledgementPacket

Called when an acknowledgement is received for a packet. The module:

1. Identifies the initiating contract from the port ID
2. Extracts success or error data from the acknowledgement
3. Calls back to the initiating contract via Sudo
4. Processes fee refunds for the acknowledgement

### OnTimeoutPacket

Called when a packet times out. The module:

1. Identifies the initiating contract from the port ID
2. Calls back to the initiating contract via Sudo
3. Processes fee refunds for the timeout
