This document provides a technical explanation of the Oracle module architecture, concepts, and design choices.

## What is the Oracle Module?

The Oracle module allows Neutron to access external data that is not directly available on the blockchain. It provides a standardized interface for smart contracts to request and retrieve accurate price information for a wide range of asset pairs.

Unlike traditional oracle systems that rely on external networks and third-party providers, Neutron's Oracle module leverages the chain's native validator set and security. This approach ensures millisecond-fresh oracle updates every block without sacrificing safety for user experience.

## How does the Oracle module work?

The Oracle module serves as a reliable source of price data for a wide range of asset pairs. It employs a multi-source approach to ensure accuracy and resilience, with several key components working together:

### Price Providers

Price providers are whitelisted entities responsible for submitting price data to the Oracle module. They retrieve price information from various sources, such as:

- Centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken
- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Osmosis and Astroport
- Other off-chain price aggregators

Each provider must be approved via governance and is expected to maintain high standards of reliability.

### Skip Connect Integration

Neutron's Oracle module is powered by Skip Connect, which is an oracle sidecar that securely delivers offchain data to onchain applications. Validators run a Skip Connect sidecar alongside their validator node to provide price data to the network.

Key components of this architecture include:
- **Validator-Run Sidecars**: Each validator runs a Skip Connect sidecar that fetches price data from multiple sources
- **Vote Extensions**: Validators include price data in their vote extensions
- **Consensus Aggregation**: The network reaches consensus on price values as part of block production
- **On-Chain Availability**: Agreed-upon prices become available within the same block

This architecture creates a highly secure, fast, and reliable oracle system that can update prices with every block.

### Price Aggregation

The module employs sophisticated aggregation algorithms to process submissions from multiple providers:

1. **Data Collection**: Receives price data from all authorized providers
2. **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and filters out anomalous submissions
3. **Weighted Averaging**: Calculates the final price based on weighted contributions
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence metrics to each aggregated price

This approach helps mitigate the impact of potential price manipulation from a single source.

### Time-Weighted Average Prices (TWAPs)

For applications requiring more stable price references, the module maintains time-weighted average prices:

1. **Historical Storage**: Retains recent price points in a ring buffer
2. **Window Calculation**: Computes averages over configurable time windows
3. **On-Demand Retrieval**: Provides TWAPs through dedicated query endpoints

TWAPs are particularly useful for lending protocols and other applications sensitive to momentary price fluctuations.

## Security Model

The Oracle module implements several mechanisms to ensure data integrity:

### Validator-Secured Data

By using the chain's own validators to provide price data, the Oracle module achieves an exceptionally high security level. Attacking the Oracle would require compromising a supermajority of validatorsâ€”the same threshold needed to attack the chain itself.

### Provider Authentication

Only addresses included in the `providers_whitelist` parameter can submit price updates. This whitelist is governed by the DAO, requiring a formal proposal to add or remove providers.

### Staleness Prevention

Prices older than the `max_price_age` parameter are considered stale and will not be served to querying contracts. This ensures that applications always work with relatively fresh data.

### Price Deviation Limits

Sudden large movements in reported prices trigger additional verification mechanisms, helping to protect against flash crashes or manipulation attempts.

### Governance-Controlled Parameters

Critical parameters like price freshness thresholds, update frequencies, and provider lists are controlled by the governance system, allowing the community to adjust security measures as needed.

## Performance Characteristics

The Oracle module is designed for high performance:

- **Update Frequency**: Price updates with every block (~100ms)
- **Asset Coverage**: Support for 2,000+ currency pairs and price feeds
- **Latency**: Millisecond-fresh data delivered within the same block
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics for system health and price accuracy

## Design Decisions

### Why use multiple price providers?

Relying on a single price source introduces a significant single point of failure. By aggregating data from multiple providers, the Oracle module:

- Reduces vulnerability to manipulation from any single provider
- Maintains functionality even if some providers temporarily fail
- Improves price accuracy through consensus mechanisms

### Why implement on-chain TWAPs?

While instantaneous spot prices are useful for many applications, TWAPs provide several benefits:

- **Reduced Volatility**: Smoothing out short-term price fluctuations
- **Manipulation Resistance**: Making it more costly to manipulate prices
- **Predictable References**: Providing more stable values for critical operations

### Why integrate with validators?

By leveraging the chain's validator set:

- **Security**: The oracle inherits the same security guarantees as the chain itself
- **Speed**: Price updates can happen with every block
- **Simplicity**: No need for additional token economics or external networks
- **Reliability**: No dependency on third-party oracle networks

### Why limit price update frequency?

The module balances freshness against network resource usage:

- Too frequent updates could congest the network with minimal benefit
- Too infrequent updates would lead to stale prices
- The current design optimizes for both resource efficiency and data freshness

## Integration with Skip Connect

Neutron validators run Skip Connect as a sidecar service that:

1. Fetches price data from multiple trusted sources
2. Aggregates and validates the price information
3. Provides this data to the validator node for inclusion in vote extensions
4. Enables per-block price updates with millisecond freshness

The application node configuration includes several parameters:

```toml
[oracle]
enabled = "true"  # Enable oracle functionality
oracle_address = "127.0.0.1:8080"  # Address of the Connect sidecar
client_timeout = "250ms"  # Timeout for client requests
metrics_enabled = "true"  # Enable metrics collection
interval = "1500ms"  # Interval for price updates
price_ttl = "10s"  # Time-to-live for price data
```

## Best Practices for Oracle Integration

When integrating the Oracle module into your application, consider these recommendations:

### Price Validity Checks

Always verify that the returned price is fresh before using it in critical operations:

```rust
// Check if price data is fresh
let current_time = env.block.time.seconds();
if price_response.last_updated < current_time - MAX_ACCEPTABLE_AGE {
    return Err(StdError::generic_err("Price data is too old"));
}
```

### TWAP vs Spot Price Selection

Choose the appropriate price type based on your application needs:

- **Spot Prices**: Best for immediate market operations and reference displays
- **TWAPs**: Better for collateral valuation, liquidations, and other sensitive calculations

### Fallback Mechanisms

Implement graceful degradation if price data becomes unavailable:

```rust
// Try primary price source first
match query_spot_price(deps, oracle_addr, base, quote) {
    Ok(price) => price,
    Err(_) => {
        // Fall back to alternative calculation
        calculate_derived_price(deps, base, quote)?
    }
}
```

### Safety Bounds

Consider implementing minimum and maximum acceptable price ranges for critical operations:

```rust
// Ensure price is within acceptable bounds
if price < MIN_ACCEPTABLE_PRICE || price > MAX_ACCEPTABLE_PRICE {
    return Err(StdError::generic_err("Price outside safe range"));
}
```

## Typical Use Cases

The Oracle module supports various applications requiring external price data:

- **DeFi protocols**: Lending platforms, DEXs, derivatives
- **Smart contract applications**: Dynamic NFTs, prediction markets
- **Cross-chain bridges**: Asset valuation across networks
- **Algorithmic stablecoins**: Peg maintenance mechanisms
- **Portfolio tracking**: On-chain valuations and analytics

## Metrics and Monitoring

The Oracle module exposes various metrics for monitoring system health:

- **Price Accuracy**: Tracking deviations across different providers
- **Update Frequency**: Monitoring timely price updates
- **Validator Participation**: Tracking which validators are providing price data
- **Response Latency**: Measuring oracle response times

These metrics help ensure the system is functioning properly and can be monitored using standard Prometheus-compatible systems.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

- **Asset Coverage**: Limited to major cryptocurrencies and tokens in the Cosmos ecosystem
- **Update Frequency**: Constrained by block times and network capacity
- **Historical Data**: Limited historical price data availability

### Planned Enhancements

- **Extended Asset Coverage**: Adding support for more exotic assets and synthetic indexes
- **Enhanced Statistical Measures**: Including volatility metrics and confidence intervals
- **Cross-Chain Oracle Integration**: Aggregating price data from other blockchain oracle systems
