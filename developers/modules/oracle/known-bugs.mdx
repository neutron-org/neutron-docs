### Price staleness during network congestion

During periods of high network congestion, price updates may be delayed, potentially leading to stale price data. The Oracle module has a protection mechanism that marks prices as stale after the `max_price_age` threshold is exceeded, but applications should implement additional safeguards:

```rust
// Always check price freshness in your application
let current_time = env.block.time.seconds();
if current_time - price_response.last_updated > MAX_ACCEPTABLE_AGE {
    return Err(StdError::generic_err("Price data is too stale"));
}
```

### Limited asset coverage

The Oracle module currently supports a limited set of popular assets. If you need price data for assets not covered by the module, you will need to implement alternative price determination methods or propose new asset pairs through governance.

### Price deviation during extreme market volatility

During periods of extreme market volatility, the Oracle's price aggregation algorithm may experience temporary inaccuracies due to the divergence of price sources. While the module includes outlier detection, these mechanisms may be less effective during market-wide volatility events.

Applications requiring high precision during volatile markets should consider implementing additional verification mechanisms, such as:

```rust
// Check for significant price changes
if previous_price > Decimal::zero() {
    let change_percentage = ((current_price - previous_price) / previous_price).abs();
    if change_percentage > MAX_ACCEPTABLE_CHANGE {
        // Implement additional verification or fallback logic
    }
}
```

### TWAP calculation with insufficient historical data

When requesting a TWAP with a window size larger than the available historical data, the module will calculate the TWAP using only the available data points rather than returning an error. This can lead to less accurate TWAPs than expected.

Applications should be aware of this behavior and implement appropriate checks:

```rust
// Check if TWAP response has enough data points
if twap_response.data_points < MIN_REQUIRED_DATA_POINTS {
    // Handle the case of insufficient historical data
}
```
