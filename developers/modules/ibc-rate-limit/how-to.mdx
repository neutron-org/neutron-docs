title: "IBC Rate Limit How-To"
---

This guide provides practical instructions for configuring and managing the IBC Rate Limit module, including setting up rate limits, monitoring transfers, and handling rate limit exceptions.

## Configuring the Rate Limit Contract

The IBC Rate Limit module delegates all rate limiting logic to a CosmWasm contract. The contract address is set through governance parameters.

### Checking Current Parameters

To check the current contract address parameter:

```bash
neutron query ibcratelimit params
```

Sample response:
```json
{
  "params": {
    "contract_address": "neutron1abcdef..."
  }
}
```

### Updating the Contract Address

To update the contract address, governance must submit a parameter change proposal:

```bash
neutron tx gov submit-proposal param-change proposal.json --from=<key> --chain-id=<chain-id>
```

Example proposal.json:
```json
{
  "title": "IBC Rate Limit Contract Address Update",
  "description": "Update the contract address for the IBC Rate Limit module",
  "changes": [
    {
      "subspace": "ibcratelimit",
      "key": "ContractAddress",
      "value": "neutron1newaddress..."
    }
  ],
  "deposit": [
    {
      "denom": "untrn", 
      "amount": "10000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Managing Rate Limits Through the Contract

Once the contract is set up, rate limits are managed through contract messages. These examples use the Neutron CLI for interaction.

### Querying Current Quotas

To check the current quotas for a specific path (channel and denomination):

```bash
neutron query wasm contract-state smart <contract-address> '{"get_quotas":{"channel_id":"channel-0","denom":"untrn"}}'
```

Sample response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "quotas": [
      {
        "name": "daily-outflow",
        "duration_seconds": 86400,
        "percentage": "0.300000000000000000",
        "channel_value": "1000000000",
        "max_percentage_reset_time": "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z",
        "flow": {
          "amount": "50000000",
          "period_end": "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Adding a Rate Limit Path

To add a new rate limit for a specific channel and denomination:

```bash
neutron tx wasm execute <contract-address> '{
  "add_path": {
    "channel_id": "channel-1",
    "denom": "ibc/27394FB092D2ECCD56123C74F36E4C1F926001CEADA9CA97EA622B25F41E5EB2",
    "quotas": [
      {
        "name": "daily-outflow",
        "duration_seconds": 86400,
        "percentage": "0.300000000000000000",
        "flow_direction": "out"
      },
      {
        "name": "weekly-outflow",
        "duration_seconds": 604800,
        "percentage": "0.500000000000000000",
        "flow_direction": "out"
      },
      {
        "name": "daily-inflow",
        "duration_seconds": 86400,
        "percentage": "0.500000000000000000",
        "flow_direction": "in"
      }
    ]
  }
}' --from=<key> --chain-id=<chain-id>
```

This example creates:
- A daily outflow limit of 30% of the total token supply
- A weekly outflow limit of 50% of the total token supply
- A daily inflow limit of 50% of the total token supply

### Removing a Rate Limit Path

To remove all rate limits for a specific path:

```bash
neutron tx wasm execute <contract-address> '{
  "remove_path": {
    "channel_id": "channel-1",
    "denom": "ibc/27394FB092D2ECCD56123C74F36E4C1F926001CEADA9CA97EA622B25F41E5EB2"
  }
}' --from=<key> --chain-id=<chain-id>
```

### Resetting a Rate Limit Quota

If a rate limit has been reached and governance decides it was a false positive or the situation has been resolved, the quota can be reset:

```bash
neutron tx wasm execute <contract-address> '{
  "reset_path_quota": {
    "channel_id": "channel-0",
    "denom": "untrn",
    "quota": "daily-outflow"
  }
}' --from=<key> --chain-id=<chain-id>
```

## Recommended Rate Limit Strategies

When setting up rate limits, consider the following strategies:

### For High-Value Assets

For tokens with high value or risk profile:

```
Daily Outflow: 30% of total supply
Weekly Outflow: 50% of total supply
Daily Inflow: 50% of total supply
Weekly Inflow: 100% of total supply  
```

### For Medium-Value Assets

For tokens with medium value or risk profile:

```
Daily Outflow: 50% of total supply
Weekly Outflow: 70% of total supply
Daily Inflow: 100% of total supply
```

### For "Any" Channel

To set a global limit that applies across all channels:

```bash
neutron tx wasm execute <contract-address> '{
  "add_path": {
    "channel_id": "any",
    "denom": "untrn",
    "quotas": [
      {
        "name": "global-daily-outflow",
        "duration_seconds": 86400,
        "percentage": "0.500000000000000000",
        "flow_direction": "out"
      }
    ]
  }
}' --from=<key> --chain-id=<chain-id>
```

This creates a safety backstop that limits the total outflow across all channels.

## Monitoring Rate Limit Usage

To effectively use the rate limit system, it's important to monitor quota usage.

### Creating a Monitoring Script

Here's a basic script concept to monitor rate limit usage:

```python
import requests
import json
import time

# Configuration
CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "neutron1abcdef..."
RPC_ENDPOINT = "https://rpc.neutron.org"
PATHS_TO_MONITOR = [
    {"channel": "channel-0", "denom": "untrn"},
    {"channel": "channel-1", "denom": "ibc/27394FB092D2ECCD56123C74F36E4C1F926001CEADA9CA97EA622B25F41E5EB2"}
]
THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE = 80  # Alert when usage reaches 80% of quota

def query_quota_usage():
    for path in PATHS_TO_MONITOR:
        query = {
            "get_quotas": {
                "channel_id": path["channel"],
                "denom": path["denom"]
            }
        }
        
        response = requests.get(
            f"{RPC_ENDPOINT}/wasm/contract/{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}/smart/{json.dumps(query)}"
        )
        
        data = response.json()["data"]
        if "quotas" in data:
            for quota in data["quotas"]:
                flow_amount = int(quota["flow"]["amount"])
                max_amount = int(quota["channel_value"]) * float(quota["percentage"])
                usage_percentage = (flow_amount / max_amount) * 100
                
                if usage_percentage >= THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE:
                    print(f"ALERT: {path['denom']} on {path['channel']} has reached {usage_percentage:.2f}% of the {quota['name']} quota")

while True:
    query_quota_usage()
    time.sleep(300)  # Check every 5 minutes
```

## Handling Rate Limit Errors

When transactions are rejected due to rate limits, they will return specific error codes. Here's how to handle them:

### Error Response

When a transfer exceeds a rate limit, it will return an error with code similar to:

```json
{
  "code": 5,
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded for channel-0 and denom untrn",
  "details": []
}
```

### User Communication

When implementing applications that interact with IBC transfers, communicate clearly to users about rate limits:

1. Inform users that transfers are subject to rate limits for security
2. When a rate limit error occurs, suggest:
   - Trying a smaller amount
   - Waiting for the next quota period
   - Splitting the transfer across multiple denominations or channels if appropriate

### Emergency Procedures

For validators and governance participants, establish procedures for handling legitimate high-volume periods:

1. Monitor rate limit usage with alerts for approaching limits
2. Have a governance process ready for quota reset proposals
3. Maintain a communication channel to coordinate responses to rate limit hits
