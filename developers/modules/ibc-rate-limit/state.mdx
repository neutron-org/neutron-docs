title: "State"
---

The IBC Rate Limit module maintains minimal state itself, as most of the rate limiting state is delegated to a CosmWasm contract. This design choice provides flexibility for updating rate limiting logic without chain upgrades.

## Module State

### Parameters

The module stores the following parameters:

```protobuf
message Params {
  string contract_address = 1;
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_address` | string | The address of the CosmWasm contract that implements the rate limiting logic |

### Storage Layout

The module parameters are stored in the params subspace under the module name:

```go
// StoreKey defines the store key for the IBC Rate Limit module
const StoreKey = "ibcratelimit"
```

## Contract State

The CosmWasm contract that implements the rate limiting logic maintains its own state. While this is technically separate from the module state, it's important to understand how this state is organized.

### Path Information

The contract stores rate limit information for each path, where a path is a combination of a channel ID and a token denomination:

```rust
struct PathInfo {
    channel_id: String,
    denom: String,
    quotas: Vec<QuotaInfo>,
}
```

### Quota Information

Each path can have multiple quotas with different time periods and directions:

```rust
struct QuotaInfo {
    name: String,
    duration_seconds: u64,
    percentage: Decimal,
    channel_value: Uint128,
    flow: Flow,
    flow_direction: FlowDirection,
    max_percentage_reset_time: Option<Timestamp>,
}
```

### Flow Tracking

The contract tracks the current flow for each quota:

```rust
struct Flow {
    amount: Uint128,
    period_end: Timestamp,
}
```

### Storage Keys

The contract organizes its state using the following storage keys:

#### Quotas Map

Stores quota information for each path:

```rust
const QUOTAS: Map<(String, String), Vec<QuotaInfo>> = Map::new("quotas");
```

Key: `(channel_id, denom)`  
Value: Vector of `QuotaInfo` objects

#### Global "Any" Channel

To support global rate limits that apply across all channels, the contract uses a special channel ID "any":

```rust
const ANY_CHANNEL: &str = "any";
```

When processing a token transfer, the contract checks both the specific channel quota and the "any" channel quota if it exists.

## State Transitions

### Module State Transitions

The module state only changes when the contract address parameter is updated:

1. **MsgUpdateParams**: Updates the contract address parameter, typically through a governance proposal

### Contract State Transitions

The contract state undergoes transitions during the following operations:

#### Adding or Updating a Path

When a path is added or updated:

1. The contract checks if the path (channel_id, denom) already exists
2. If it exists, it merges the new quotas with existing ones or updates them
3. If it doesn't exist, it creates a new entry with the provided quotas
4. For each quota, it initializes:
   - The starting channel value (total supply for the denomination)
   - The flow amount (starting at 0)
   - The period end timestamp (based on the current time plus duration)

#### Removing a Path

When a path is removed:

1. The contract deletes the entry for the path (channel_id, denom) from the quotas map

#### Resetting a Quota

When a quota is reset:

1. The contract locates the specific quota by path and name
2. It resets the flow amount to 0
3. It updates the period end timestamp based on the current time plus duration

#### Processing Token Transfers

When a token is sent or received:

1. The contract identifies the relevant path(s)
2. For each quota on the path:
   - If the period has ended, it resets the flow and starts a new period
   - It calculates the maximum allowed transfer based on:
     - The channel value
     - The quota percentage
     - The current flow
   - It updates the flow amount based on the net change
   - It verifies that the flow amount doesn't exceed the quota limit

#### Handling Failed Transfers

When a send operation fails (timeout or error acknowledgement):

1. The contract identifies the relevant path(s)
2. For each quota on the path:
   - It reduces the flow amount by the token amount that failed to transfer

## Querying State

### Module State Queries

The module provides a query endpoint to retrieve the current module parameters:

```go
// Params returns the current module parameters
rpc Params(QueryParamsRequest) returns (QueryParamsResponse);
```

### Contract State Queries

The contract provides a query endpoint to retrieve quota information for a path:

```rust
// GetQuotas returns the quotas for a specific path
fn get_quotas(channel_id: String, denom: String) -> Vec<QuotaInfo>;
```

This query returns the current state of all quotas for the specified channel and denomination.
