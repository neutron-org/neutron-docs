title: "Messages"

The IBC Rate Limit module exposes a single message for governance to update the module parameters. The primary rate limit functionality is delegated to a CosmWasm contract, which has its own message interface.

## Module Messages

### MsgUpdateParams

`MsgUpdateParams` updates the module's parameters. This message can only be executed by the module's authority (typically governance).

```protobuf
message MsgUpdateParams {
  option (amino.name) = "neutron/ibc-rate-limit/MsgUpdateParams";
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "authority";

  string authority = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];
  Params params = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false, (amino.dont_omitempty) = true];
}
```

#### Parameters

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authority` | string | The address of the account with authority to update parameters (typically the governance module account) |
| `params` | Params | The new parameters to set |

#### Params Structure

```protobuf
message Params {
  string contract_address = 1 [(gogoproto.moretags) = "yaml:\"contract_address\"", (gogoproto.nullable) = true];
}
```

#### Example

```javascript
{
  "authority": "neutron10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6z2zm3",
  "params": {
    "contract_address": "neutron1abcdef..."
  }
}
```

#### Response

```protobuf
message MsgUpdateParamsResponse {}
```

### Processing

When `MsgUpdateParams` is processed:

1. The module validates that the sender is the authorized governance account
2. It updates the contract address parameter in the params subspace
3. It returns an empty response

## Contract Messages

Since most of the rate limiting logic is delegated to a CosmWasm contract, it's important to understand the contract's message interface as well.

### ExecuteMsg

#### AddPath

`AddPath` adds or updates rate limit quotas for a specific channel and denomination.

```rust
pub struct AddPath {
    pub channel_id: String,
    pub denom: String,
    pub quotas: Vec<Quota>,
}
```

Parameters:
- `channel_id`: The IBC channel ID (e.g., "channel-0") or "any" for a global limit
- `denom`: The token denomination (e.g., "untrn" or "ibc/...")
- `quotas`: List of quota definitions

Example:
```json
{
  "add_path": {
    "channel_id": "channel-0",
    "denom": "untrn",
    "quotas": [
      {
        "name": "daily-outflow",
        "duration_seconds": 86400,
        "percentage": "0.30",
        "flow_direction": "out"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### RemovePath

`RemovePath` removes all rate limits for a specific channel and denomination.

```rust
pub struct RemovePath {
    pub channel_id: String,
    pub denom: String,
}
```

Parameters:
- `channel_id`: The IBC channel ID
- `denom`: The token denomination

Example:
```json
{
  "remove_path": {
    "channel_id": "channel-0",
    "denom": "untrn"
  }
}
```

#### ResetPathQuota

`ResetPathQuota` resets a specific quota if it has been exceeded.

```rust
pub struct ResetPathQuota {
    pub channel_id: String,
    pub denom: String,
    pub quota: String,
}
```

Parameters:
- `channel_id`: The IBC channel ID
- `denom`: The token denomination
- `quota`: The name of the quota to reset

Example:
```json
{
  "reset_path_quota": {
    "channel_id": "channel-0",
    "denom": "untrn",
    "quota": "daily-outflow"
  }
}
```

### SudoMsg

SudoMsg variants can only be called by the chain itself, not by users or contracts directly.

#### SendPacket

`SendPacket` is called by the middleware when a token transfer packet is being sent from Neutron to another chain.

```rust
pub struct SendPacket {
    pub packet: Packet,
}
```

Processing:
1. The contract extracts the token denomination and amount from the packet
2. It calculates the current channel value for the token
3. It updates the outflow tracking for each quota
4. It verifies that no quota has been exceeded
5. If any quota is exceeded, it returns an error that causes the packet to be rejected

#### RecvPacket

`RecvPacket` is called by the middleware when a token transfer packet is being received by Neutron from another chain.

```rust
pub struct RecvPacket {
    pub packet: Packet,
}
```

Processing:
1. The contract extracts the token denomination and amount from the packet
2. It determines the local denomination of the token on Neutron
3. It calculates the current channel value for the token
4. It updates the inflow tracking for each quota
5. It verifies that no quota has been exceeded
6. If any quota is exceeded, it returns an error that causes the packet to be rejected

#### UndoSend

`UndoSend` is called by the middleware when a previously sent packet fails due to an error acknowledgement or timeout.

```rust
pub struct UndoSend {
    pub packet: Packet,
}
```

Processing:
1. The contract extracts the token denomination and amount from the packet
2. It reverses the outflow tracking for each quota
3. This ensures that quota space is freed up for failed packets

### QueryMsg

#### GetQuotas

`GetQuotas` returns the current quotas and usage for a specific channel and denomination.

```rust
pub struct GetQuotas {
    pub channel_id: String,
    pub denom: String,
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "quotas": [
    {
      "name": "daily-outflow",
      "duration_seconds": 86400,
      "percentage": "0.300000000000000000",
      "channel_value": "1000000000",
      "max_percentage_reset_time": "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z",
      "flow": {
        "amount": "50000000",
        "period_end": "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Contract Data Structures

### Quota

```rust
pub struct Quota {
    pub name: String,
    pub duration_seconds: u64,
    pub percentage: Decimal,
    pub flow_direction: FlowDirection,
}
```

Fields:
- `name`: Unique identifier for the quota
- `duration_seconds`: Duration of the quota period in seconds
- `percentage`: Maximum percentage of the token's supply that can flow in the specified direction during the period
- `flow_direction`: Either "in" or "out"

### FlowDirection

```rust
pub enum FlowDirection {
    In,
    Out,
}
```

### Packet

Represents an IBC packet with token transfer data.

```rust
pub struct Packet {
    pub sequence: u64,
    pub source_port: String,
    pub source_channel: String,
    pub destination_port: String,
    pub destination_channel: String,
    pub data: FungibleTokenPacketData,
    pub timeout_height: Height,
    pub timeout_timestamp: u64,
}
```

### FungibleTokenPacketData

Contains the token transfer details.

    pub amount: String,
    pub sender: String,
    pub receiver: String,
