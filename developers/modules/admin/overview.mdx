title: "Admin Module"
description: "Central governance module enabling DAO-driven network administration and proposal execution"
---

The admin module serves as Neutron's central governance mechanism, empowering the **Main DAO contract** to propose and execute critical network operations. Built with Cosmos SDK compatibility and upgraded for SDK 0.50, this module enables secure, controlled administration of the entire Neutron network.

<Info>
The admin module can **only** be accessed by the Main DAO contract through WebAssembly bindings. Individual users cannot directly interact with this module - all operations must go through Neutron's governance process.
</Info>

The admin module provides a unified interface for governance operations, supporting both legacy proposal mechanisms and modern message-based execution. Through careful whitelisting and permission controls, it ensures that only authorized operations can be performed while maintaining the flexibility needed for network evolution.

## Concepts

The admin module operates on the principle of controlled delegation, where the **Neutron Main DAO contract** acts as the network's administrator with the authority to execute proposals that can significantly change the network state. This includes:

- **Parameter Modifications**: Adjusting module parameters such as transaction fees, validator incentives, and governance thresholds
- **Smart Contract Management**: Executing WebAssembly (WASM) proposals for contract instantiation, migration, and administration
- **Network Upgrades**: Coordinating protocol upgrades and consensus parameter changes
- **Message Execution**: Processing any valid `sdk.Msg` through the governance framework

### Dual Proposal Mechanism

The admin module supports two distinct proposal execution paths:

1. **Legacy Proposals**: Traditional governance proposals rooted in the Cosmos SDK's `x/gov` module, supporting predefined proposals like `MigrateContract`, `InstantiateContract`, and parameter changes. These proposals are processed through dedicated handlers and remain supported for backward compatibility with modules like IBC that haven't fully transitioned to SDK 0.47 patterns.

2. **Message-Based Proposals**: Modern proposal execution introduced with SDK 0.47+, allowing any valid `sdk.Msg` to be executed through governance. This approach provides greater flexibility using the versatile `sdk.Msg` format and requires modules to implement an `authority` field specifying permitted addresses.

### Security Through Whitelisting

To maintain network security while enabling governance flexibility, the admin module implements a comprehensive whitelisting system. Only pre-approved message types and operations can be executed through the governance process, preventing potential security vulnerabilities while allowing legitimate administrative functions.

## Main DAO Integration

The admin module is exclusively accessible through Neutron's Main DAO contract via WebAssembly bindings. This tight integration ensures that all network administration flows through the democratic governance process while maintaining the technical capability to execute complex administrative operations.

The module processes `ProposalExecuteMessage` bindings from the Main DAO, enabling the governance system to trigger administrative actions. Signer verification ensures that only the authorized DAO contract can initiate these operations.

### Administration Workflow

1. **DAO Proposal Creation**: Governance proposals are created and voted on through the Neutron DAO
2. **Message Validation**: The admin module validates that proposed messages are whitelisted and properly formatted
3. **Authority Verification**: The module confirms that the sender is the authorized Main DAO contract
4. **Execution**: Approved proposals are executed immediately within the message server context

## Evolution from Legacy Systems

The admin module represents an evolution from earlier administrative systems, incorporating lessons learned from SDK transitions and governance best practices. It maintains backward compatibility with legacy proposal types while providing a path forward for modern governance mechanisms.

Key improvements include:
- Elimination of active/inactive proposal queues for immediate execution
- Streamlined message processing without cache contexts
- Enhanced security through comprehensive whitelisting
- Support for both legacy and modern proposal formats
- Direct integration with DAO governance contracts
