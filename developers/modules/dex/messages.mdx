The Dex module exposes several message types for interacting with the decentralized exchange. Here's a detailed documentation of each message and its expected behavior.

## MsgDeposit

`MsgDeposit` allows users to add liquidity to concentrated liquidity pools.

```protobuf
message MsgDeposit {
  option (amino.name) = "dex/MsgDeposit";
  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "creator";

  string creator = 1;
  string receiver = 2;
  string token_a = 3;
  string token_b = 4;
  repeated string amounts_a = 5 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "cosmossdk.io/math.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
  repeated string amounts_b = 6 [
    (gogoproto.customtype) = "cosmossdk.io/math.Int",
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false
  ];
  repeated int64 tick_indexes_a_to_b = 7;
  repeated uint64 fees = 8;
  repeated DepositOptions options = 9;
}

message DepositOptions {
  bool disable_autoswap = 1;
  bool fail_tx_on_bel = 2;
  bool swap_on_deposit = 3;
  uint64 swap_on_deposit_slop_tolerance_bps = 4;
