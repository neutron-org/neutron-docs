title: "Dex Overview"

The Dex module implements a decentralized exchange on Neutron, providing users with the ability to trade tokens, provide liquidity, and place limit orders. The module introduces a novel AMM design centered around constant-price liquidity pools that offer simplicity, flexibility, and capital efficiency.

## Key Features

### Constant-Price Liquidity Pools

The fundamental building block of Neutron DEX is the constant-price liquidity pool, where liquidity is concentrated at specific price points (ticks). This design:

- Enables zero or near-zero slippage trades for stablecoins and highly correlated assets
- Allows liquidity providers to precisely target their capital to specific price ranges
- Significantly improves capital efficiency compared to traditional AMM designs

### Flexible Trading Options

Neutron DEX supports multiple trading mechanisms:

- **Market Orders**: Swap tokens at the current market price via multi-hop routing
- **Limit Orders**: Place orders to buy or sell tokens at a specified price
- **Liquidity Provision**: Add liquidity to pools and earn trading fees

### Shared Liquidity

Neutron DEX reduces liquidity fragmentation through its shared liquidity model:

- All liquidity providers share the same underlying pools
- Liquidity providers can create any feasible AMM curve by distributing liquidity strategically
- Trading volume aggregates across all liquidity providers, enhancing capital efficiency

## Module Capabilities

The Dex module enables:

1. **Pool Management**: Create and manage liquidity pools with specific price points and fee levels
2. **Deposits and Withdrawals**: Add or remove liquidity from pools
3. **Swapping**: Execute trades between token pairs with optimal routing
4. **Limit Orders**: Place, fill, and cancel limit orders
5. **Fee Collection**: Earn fees as a liquidity provider proportional to contribution

## Integration with Neutron

The Dex module is a core component of Neutron, leveraging the blockchain's:

- Fast finality for trade execution
- MEV protections at the consensus level
- Low transaction costs through app-specific infrastructure
- Integration with other Neutron modules like the Transfer module for IBC tokens

## Trade Types and Order Matching

Neutron DEX provides several limit order types:

- **Good Til Cancelled (GTC)**: Remain active until explicitly cancelled
- **Fill or Kill (FOK)**: Execute entirely or not at all
- **Immediate or Cancel (IOC)**: Fill as much as possible immediately, then cancel any unfilled portion
- **Good Til Time (GTT)**: Remain active until a specified expiration time
- **Just in Time (JIT)**: Special limit orders that can only be filled by takers

Order matching follows a price-time priority model, where orders at better prices are filled first, and within the same price, older orders take precedence.
