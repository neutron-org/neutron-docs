This page documents known bugs and limitations in the Dex module.

## Current Limitations

### Price Calculation Precision

The price calculation for extremely large or small tick indexes may experience precision issues due to the exponential formula `1.0001^i`. When dealing with tokens that have vastly different value scales, consider:

- Using appropriate tick indexes that avoid extreme values
- Testing trades with small amounts first before executing large trades
- Being aware that displayed prices may have minor rounding differences from actual execution prices

### Multi-Hop Swap Routing

When using multi-hop swaps with many hops (>5), you might encounter:

- Increased computation cost that may exceed block gas limits
- Degraded price execution due to compounding slippage
- Higher chance of route failure if any intermediate pool has insufficient liquidity

For complex routes, consider breaking them into smaller segments or using simulation queries to verify feasibility before execution.

### Limit Order Fill Behavior

When placing limit orders, be aware that:

- Fill or Kill (FOK) orders may fail in volatile market conditions even when the price briefly crosses the limit price
- Good Til Time (GTT) orders do not guarantee execution even if the price reaches the specified level before expiration
- If the blockchain is congested, order execution might be delayed, potentially affecting fill prices

### Deposit and Withdrawal Precision

When adding or removing liquidity:

- Very small deposits may result in zero share tokens due to rounding
- When withdrawing small amounts of shares, you might receive slightly less than expected due to rounding
- Imbalanced deposits with the `disable_autoswap` option may result in unused tokens remaining in your account

## Resolved Issues

Previous versions of the Dex module had the following issues that have been resolved:

### v4 to v5 Migration

The v4 to v5 migration fixed:

- Limit order expiration handling for GTT orders
- Price calculation for negative tick indexes
- Share token calculation for certain edge cases

### Fee Calculation Improvements

Recent updates have addressed:

- Fee distribution proportionality issues for imbalanced liquidity providers
- Precision loss in fee accrual for very small trades
- Inconsistent fee application across multiple hops
