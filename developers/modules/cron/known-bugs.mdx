### Execution delay during high network congestion

During periods of high network congestion, the Cron module's execution might be delayed. This is because the module has a per-block gas limit (`max_gas_per_block`) that restricts how many scheduled tasks can execute in a single block. If there are more due schedules than can fit within this gas limit, some will be postponed to subsequent blocks.

Applications requiring precise timing should implement additional verification mechanisms:

```rust
// Check if execution happened within acceptable time window
let current_height = deps.env.block.height;
let expected_execution_height = last_execution_height + period;
let delay = current_height - expected_execution_height;

if delay > MAX_ACCEPTABLE_DELAY {
    // Log warning or take corrective action
    return Err(StdError::generic_err(format!(
        "Schedule execution delayed by {} blocks",
        delay
    )));
}
```

### Message gas estimation issues

When specifying gas limits for scheduled messages, the module relies on the user-provided estimates. If these estimates are too low, schedule execution may fail with out-of-gas errors.

To mitigate this issue, always add a safety buffer to your gas estimates:

```rust
// Example of setting a conservative gas limit with a buffer
let estimated_gas = 50_000;
let safety_buffer = 20_000; // 40% buffer
let gas_limit = estimated_gas + safety_buffer;
```

### Boundary parameter behavior

The `boundary` parameter in schedules is designed to specify a starting height for execution. However, there's a known issue where if a schedule with a `boundary` is created and the current height is already past that boundary, the schedule will execute immediately in the next block rather than waiting for the next period.

This can lead to unexpected immediate executions when setting up schedules intended for future use. To avoid this, always ensure your boundary is set to a future block height:

```rust
// Ensure boundary is in the future
let current_height = env.block.height;
let boundary = current_height + 100; // At least 100 blocks in the future
```

### Schedule name conflicts

The module identifies schedules by their name, which must be unique. If a contract attempts to create a schedule with a name that already exists (even if owned by a different contract), the creation will fail.

To avoid naming conflicts, especially in public environments where multiple contracts might create schedules:

```rust
// Use a prefix specific to your contract
let unique_prefix = env.contract.address.to_string();
let schedule_name = format!("{}_daily_rewards", unique_prefix);
```

### Long-running schedules with changing block times

For schedules intended to run over long periods (weeks, months), be aware that the block time can change due to network upgrades or other factors. Since the module uses block heights for scheduling, a change in block time will affect the real-world timing of scheduled executions.

For applications where precise timing is critical, consider:

```rust
// Adjust period based on current block time
let target_seconds = 86400; // 1 day in seconds
let block_time_seconds = 12; // Current block time
let period = target_seconds / block_time_seconds;

// Or dynamically adjust in your contract
pub fn update_schedule_period(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    current_block_time: u64,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let schedule = SCHEDULES.load(deps.storage, "my_schedule")?;
    let target_seconds = 86400; // 1 day in seconds
    let new_period = target_seconds / current_block_time;
    
    // Update schedule with new period...
}
```
