description: "Schedule automated smart contract executions with precise timing"
---

This document explains the `cron` module for the Neutron network.

The Cron module allows developers to schedule automatic smart contract executions at predefined times or intervals, similar to Unix cron jobs. This feature is essential for creating time-based automation in blockchain applications, enabling scheduled operations without requiring external triggers.

## Concepts

The Cron module serves as an on-chain time-based scheduling system that enables smart contracts to:

- **Schedule Future Executions**: Register messages to be executed after a certain number of blocks
- **Create Periodic Tasks**: Set up recurring executions at regular intervals
- **Manage Time-Based Workflows**: Chain multiple contract executions in a sequence

### Key Features

#### Block-Based Scheduling

The module primarily works with block heights for scheduling:

- **Period**: The number of blocks between recurring executions
- **Boundary**: An optional starting point (specific block height)
- **One-time Execution**: By setting period to 0, a schedule executes only once

#### Secure Execution Context

- Tasks are executed within the blockchain's secure context
- Execution is deterministic and follows the same rules as any other transaction
- Schedules are identified by unique names for easy management

#### Gas Management

The module uses a pre-payment model for gas:

- Schedule creators specify a gas limit for each message execution
- The module ensures each execution has sufficient gas
- There's a network-wide limit on gas consumption per block

## Operation Flow

A typical workflow using the Cron module consists of:

1. **Schedule Creation**: A contract creates a schedule by specifying:
   - A unique name
   - The execution period (in blocks)
   - Messages to execute
   - Gas limits for each message

2. **Schedule Tracking**: The module maintains a registry of all schedules and tracks their execution status.

3. **Automatic Execution**: When a block is produced, the module:
   - Identifies schedules due for execution
   - Executes their messages with the specified gas limits
   - Updates their last execution height

4. **Schedule Management**: Contracts can:
   - Update their schedules to modify periods or messages
   - Remove schedules when they're no longer needed

## Integration with Smart Contracts

The Cron module integrates with smart contracts through:

- **Schedule Creation**: Contracts send messages to create schedules
- **Execution Callbacks**: The scheduled messages are sent to target contracts
- **Schedule Management**: Contracts can update or remove their schedules

This allows developers to implement various time-based functionalities such as:

- Regular protocol maintenance operations
- Vesting and distribution schedules
- Time-sensitive DeFi operations
- Auction deadlines and lifecycle management
