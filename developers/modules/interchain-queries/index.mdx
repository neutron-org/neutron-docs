# Interchain Queries Module

The Interchain Queries module allows Neutron smart contracts to retrieve data from remote chains connected to Neutron via IBC. This module is essential for cross-chain functionality, enabling contracts to access state and transaction data from other blockchains without requiring trust in third-party oracles.
