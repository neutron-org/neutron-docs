This section contains tutorials to help you get started with Neutron development. The onboarding tutorials cover essential setup steps and introduce you to the basic concepts needed for developing on Neutron.

## Available Tutorials

- [Cosmopark Setup](/developers/tutorials/onboarding/cosmopark) - Learn how to set up a local development environment with interconnected Neutron and Gaia nodes for IBC and ICQ testing

## Detailed Development Guides

For a comprehensive walkthrough of building applications on Neutron, we have a multi-part onboarding series:

## Development Environments

Neutron offers multiple options for setting up your development environment:

1. **Standalone Neutron Node**: Simplest setup for basic smart contract development
2. **Cosmopark**: Comprehensive environment with Neutron, Gaia, IBC and ICQ relayers for testing interchain features
3. **Public Testnet**: For testing in a shared network environment before mainnet deployment

### When to Use Cosmopark

The Cosmopark environment is particularly useful when:
- Developing contracts that use Interchain Accounts (ICA)
- Building applications that rely on Interchain Queries (ICQ)
- Testing IBC token transfers between chains
- Simulating interactions between Neutron and other Cosmos chains

## Recommended Prerequisites

Before diving into Neutron development, we recommend:

1. Familiarity with blockchain concepts
2. Basic understanding of the Cosmos SDK
3. Experience with at least one programming language (Rust is preferred for CosmWasm development)
