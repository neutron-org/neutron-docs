description: "Set up a local IBC-enabled development environment with Neutron and Gaia"
---

Cosmopark is an advanced local development environment that sets up multiple interconnected components:

1. Neutron node
2. Gaia node (Cosmos Hub)
3. Hermes IBC Relayer
4. Neutron ICQ Relayer

This environment is ideal for developing and testing applications that use Interchain Accounts (ICA), Interchain Queries (ICQ), or any other IBC-related features of Neutron.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Cosmopark, ensure you have:

- **Docker Engine**: Used to run containerized services
- **Golang v1.23+**: Required for building components
- **NPX**: Used to download Neutron DAO contracts

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run Cosmopark:

### 1. Verify Go Version

Ensure you have the required Go version installed:

```bash
go version
```

The output should show Go version 1.23 or later.

### 2. Clone Required Repositories

All repositories must be cloned into the same parent directory:

```bash
# Create and enter a directory for all repositories
mkdir neutron-dev && cd neutron-dev

# Clone Neutron repositories
git clone -b main https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
git clone https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-integration-tests.git
git clone https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-query-relayer.git

# Clone and prepare Gaia
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/gaia.git
cd gaia
git checkout v23.1.1
cd ..
```

### 3. Build Docker Images

The neutron-integration-tests repository contains scripts to build all required Docker images:

```bash
cd neutron-integration-tests/setup

# Build all images at once (first time)
make build-all

# For later updates, you can build individual components:
# make build-gaia
# make build-neutron
# make build-hermes
# make build-relayer
```

### 4. Download Neutron DAO Contracts

Neutron includes DAO contracts in its genesis, so you need to download them:

```bash
npx @neutron-org/get-artifacts neutron-dao -b main -d contracts
```

### 5. Start Cosmopark

Launch the entire Cosmopark environment:

```bash
make start-cosmopark
```

This command starts the Neutron node, Gaia node, Hermes relayer, and ICQ relayer in Docker containers.

### 6. View Logs and Manage Containers

To view logs from all containers:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

To see logs from a specific container:

```bash
# List running containers
docker ps

# View logs for a specific container
docker logs -f <container-id>
```

To stop Cosmopark:

```bash
make stop-cosmopark
```

## Using Cosmopark Components

### Neutron Node

The Neutron node in Cosmopark is configured with:

- Exposed RPC port: 26657
- Exposed REST API port: 1317
- Pre-configured test accounts with funds

Access the node using the standard `neutrond` CLI:

```bash
# Example: Query account balance
neutrond q bank balances neutron1m9l358xunhhwds0568za49mzhvuxx9ux8xafx2 --node http://localhost:26657
```

### Gaia Node

The Gaia node represents the Cosmos Hub and is connected to Neutron via IBC:

- Exposed RPC port: 26659
- Exposed REST API port: 1318

You can interact with Gaia using the `gaiad` CLI:

```bash
# Example: Query account
gaiad q auth account cosmos1m9l358xunhhwds0568za49mzhvuxx9uxpdsv0e --node http://localhost:26659
```

### Hermes IBC Relayer

Hermes maintains the IBC connections between Neutron and Gaia, allowing for IBC transfers and Interchain Accounts:

- Automatically creates connections and channels on startup
- Continuously relays packets between chains

### ICQ Relayer

The Interchain Query Relayer enables Neutron smart contracts to securely query data from the Gaia chain:

- Monitors registered queries from Neutron contracts
- Fetches data with proofs from Gaia
- Submits responses back to Neutron

## Advanced Usage

### Testing Interchain Accounts

You can use Cosmopark to test ICA functionality by:

1. Deploying an ICA-enabled contract on Neutron
2. Registering a connection to Gaia
3. Executing transactions on Gaia via your Neutron contract

### Testing Interchain Queries

To test ICQ functionality:

1. Deploy a contract that uses the ICQ module
2. Register queries for specific Gaia state
3. Receive and process query responses in your contract

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Cosmopark:

- Ensure all repositories are in the same parent directory
- Check that Docker has sufficient resources allocated
- Verify all ports required by the services are available
- Review logs for specific error messages

For more specific guidance, refer to the README files in the neutron-integration-tests repository.

## Next Steps

After setting up Cosmopark, you can:

- Deploy test CosmWasm contracts to Neutron
- Test IBC transfers between Neutron and Gaia
- Develop and test Interchain Account controllers
- Create contracts that utilize Interchain Queries
