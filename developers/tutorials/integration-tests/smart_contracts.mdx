An improved integration tests framework is available for testing smart contracts, based on [Cosmopark](https://github.com/neutron-org/cosmopark/) and [Contracts2ts](https://github.com/neutron-org/contracts2ts). This approach offers a more elegant testing experience compared to chain integration tests.

## Key Components

### Cosmopark

Cosmopark runs multiple networks on the same machine using Docker containers. It can spin up `Hermes Relayer` and `Neutron Query Relayer` for your deployment if required.

### Contracts2ts

Contracts2ts generates TypeScript clients for your contracts using JSON schemas generated with the `write_api` method, making contract interaction in tests more straightforward.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the integration tests framework:

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/demo-integration-tests)
2. Place your contract source code in the `contracts` folder (the included `pump` contract is just an example and can be removed)
3. Run `make schema` to generate JSON schemas for your contracts
4. Run `make build` to build your contracts
5. Navigate to the integration tests directory: `cd integration-tests`
6. Install dependencies: `yarn`
7. Build Docker images: `yarn build-images`
8. Build TypeScript client for your contracts: `yarn build-ts-client`
9. Implement your tests in the `src/testcases` folder (the existing `pump` test files are examples which can be removed)
10. Run your tests: `yarn test`

## Understanding the Test Structure

The integration tests directory contains several important components:

- **src/testSuite.ts**: Contains configuration of the networks with defined network parameters and Docker image names.
- **src/testcases**: Contains the tests for the contracts. Each test is a separate file with a set of tests for a contract.
- **src/vite.config.ts**: Contains the configuration for the tests.

When writing tests, use the `beforeAll` method to configure networks and deploy contracts. Check the existing tests to understand the structure and approach.

## Environment Variables

You can configure the test environment using the following environment variables:

```
MAX_THREADS - Maximum threads to run tests in parallel
```

## Example Test

Here's a simplified example of what a test file might look like:

```typescript
import { TestingApp } from '../testSuite';
import { MyContract } from '../types/MyContract';

describe('My Contract Tests', () => {
  let app: TestingApp;
  let myContract: MyContract;
  let contractAddress: string;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Initialize the test environment
    app = new TestingApp();
    await app.start();
    
    // Upload and instantiate your contract
    const { codeId } = await app.neutron.uploadContract('my_contract.wasm');
    const result = await app.neutron.instantiateContract(codeId, {
      admin: app.neutron.wallets.admin.address,
      // Additional instantiation parameters as needed
    });
    
    contractAddress = result.contractAddress;
    myContract = new MyContract(app.neutron.client, app.neutron.wallets.admin, contractAddress);
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await app.stop();
  });

  test('Contract initialization', async () => {
    // Test that the contract was instantiated correctly
    const state = await myContract.getState();
    expect(state).toHaveProperty('initialized', true);
  });

  test('Contract functionality', async () => {
    // Test your contract's functionality
    await myContract.executeMethod({ param1: 'value1' });
    const newState = await myContract.getState();
    expect(newState).toHaveProperty('someValue', 'expectedValue');
  });
});
```

## Benefits of Using This Framework

- **Realistic Testing Environment**: Tests run against actual blockchain nodes, providing a more accurate testing environment.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Generated TypeScript clients make it easy to interact with your contracts.
- **Multiple Network Support**: Test cross-chain functionality with multiple networks running simultaneously.
- **Docker-based**: Consistent and reproducible test environment using Docker containers.
