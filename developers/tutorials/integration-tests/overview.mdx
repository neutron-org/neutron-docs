## Why Integration Testing Matters

Integration testing goes beyond basic unit tests by:

1. Testing how different components interact with each other
2. Simulating realistic blockchain conditions
3. Verifying that your application works as expected in a chain environment
4. Catching bugs that might only appear in specific chain contexts

## Recommended Tools

For testing Neutron applications, we recommend:

- **cw-multi-test**: A framework for testing CosmWasm contracts
- **Rust's testing framework**: For unit testing individual functions
- **Neutron's testing utilities**: For simulating Neutron-specific features
- **Docker**: For setting up isolated testing environments

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the integration testing tutorials, you should:

1. Be comfortable with Rust programming
2. Understand the basics of CosmWasm contract development
3. Have completed the [Onboarding Tutorials](/developers/tutorials/onboarding/overview)
4. Have a project ready to test
