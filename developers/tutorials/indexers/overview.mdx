## Why Indexers Matter

Blockchains like Neutron are optimized for consensus and security, not for complex queries. Indexers solve this problem by:

1. Extracting data from the blockchain into optimized databases
2. Enabling complex queries that would be impossible or too slow on-chain
3. Supporting real-time data feeds for applications
4. Reducing load on blockchain nodes

## Recommended Tools

For building indexers for Neutron, we recommend:

- **SubQuery**: A flexible indexing solution for Cosmos chains
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing indexed data
- **GraphQL**: For querying indexed data
- **Docker**: For containerizing your indexer

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the indexer development tutorials, you should:

1. Have a basic understanding of databases and SQL
2. Be familiar with Neutron's data structures and event system
3. Have experience with at least one programming language (typically JavaScript/TypeScript or Go)
4. Understand the basics of GraphQL (for some indexers)
