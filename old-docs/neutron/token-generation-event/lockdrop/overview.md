# Overview

The lockdrop contract allows users to lock of LP tokens from `axlrUSDC/NTRN` and `ATOM/NTRN` pools for a selected duration against which they will receive `NTRN` tokens pro-rata to their weighted share of the LP tokens to the total deposited LP tokens for that particular pool in the contract.

> **Note**: Users can open multiple lockup positions with different lockup duration for each LP Token pool.
