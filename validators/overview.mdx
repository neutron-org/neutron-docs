Neutron validators secure the network by operating nodes that participate in consensus, validate transactions, and provide critical oracle data. Following the Mercury upgrade in April 2025, Neutron transitioned to a fully sovereign network with a unique validator model.

## Neutron's Validator Model

Neutron's validator model differs fundamentally from traditional Proof of Stake networks:

## Performance Requirements

Validators operate under strict performance criteria, with rewards tied directly to maintaining high-quality service:

| Performance Criterion | Minimum Threshold | Full Reward Threshold |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Block Signing         | 95%               | 99\.5%                |
| Oracle Price Updates  | 95%               | 98%                  |

Validators who fail to meet minimum thresholds for two consecutive months or three months in a six-month period may be rotated out of the active set by the Neutron DAO.

## Node Hardware Requirements

### Prioritize High Single-Thread CPU Performance

- **Key takeaway:** CometBFT and the Cosmos-SDK rely heavily on sequential/single-threaded processing (consensus → block processing → validation). A CPU's *single-core* performance is more critical than overall core count.
- **Recommended CPUs:**
    - **AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D** (16c/32t, 4.2–5.7 GHz)
    - **AMD EPYC 4584PX** (16c/32t, 4.2–5.7 GHz)
- **Alternatives:** Other CPUs with **high base and boost clocks** (≥3.5–4.0 GHz base) and at least **16 cores**. However, the above models have proven track record for fast blocks.

### Memory Requirements

- **Minimum:** 64 GB RAM
- **Recommended:** 128 GB RAM for optimal performance
- **Type:** DDR4-3200 or DDR5-4800+ for maximum throughput

### Storage Specifications

- **Primary Storage:** 2 TB NVMe SSD (minimum)
- **Recommended:** 4 TB NVMe SSD for future growth
- **Performance:** ≥10,000 IOPS, ≥500 MB/s sustained read/write
- **Backup:** Additional storage for state snapshots and backups

### Network Requirements

- **Bandwidth:** Minimum 1 Gbps dedicated connection
- **Latency:** &lt;50ms to major network peers
- **Redundancy:** Multiple network providers recommended
- **DDoS Protection:** Enterprise-grade protection required

## Key Selection Criteria

  <Card title="Dual Network Operation" icon="network-wired">
    Validators must run both mainnet and testnet nodes

  <Card title="Technical Infrastructure" icon="server">
    High-quality hardware with redundancy and monitoring

## Mercury Upgrade

The Mercury upgrade in April 2025 marked a pivotal transition for Neutron, moving from Interchain Security (ICS) to a fully sovereign network. This enabled:

- Native NTRN staking with fixed supply tokenomics
- Performance improvements with reduced latency (~100ms) and increased throughput
- Better stability for the High Frequency Oracle and other infrastructure
- Faster upgrades and incident response capabilities
