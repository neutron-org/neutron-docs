Neutron validators secure the network by operating nodes that participate in consensus, validate transactions, and provide critical oracle data. Following the Mercury upgrade in April 2025, Neutron transitioned to a fully sovereign network with a unique validator model.

## Neutron's Validator Model

Neutron's validator model differs fundamentally from traditional Proof of Stake networks:

  <Card title="Fixed Supply" icon="coins">
    No inflation-based block rewards, preserving NTRN's fixed supply economics

## Performance Requirements

Validators operate under strict performance criteria, with rewards tied directly to maintaining high-quality service:

| Performance Criterion | Minimum Threshold | Full Reward Threshold |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Block Signing         | 95%               | 99.5%                |
| Oracle Price Updates  | 95%               | 98%                  |

Validators who fail to meet minimum thresholds for two consecutive months or three months in a six-month period may be rotated out of the active set by the Neutron DAO.

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Specifications

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CPU" icon="microchip" iconType="duotone">
    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 4+ cores<br />
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> 8+ cores, AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D or EPYC 4584PX for optimal single-thread performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="RAM" icon="memory" iconType="duotone">
    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 64 GB<br />
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> 128 GB+ for optimal performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage" icon="hard-drive" iconType="duotone">
    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 2 TB NVMe SSD<br />
    <strong>Recommended:</strong> 4 TB+ with ≥10,000 IOPS and ≥500 MB/s sustained read/write
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network" icon="network-wired" iconType="duotone">
    <strong>Minimum:</strong> 1 Gbps dedicated connection<br />

### Infrastructure Requirements

  <Card title="Dual Network Operation" icon="network-wired">
    Must run both mainnet and testnet nodes with proven reliability
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security Architecture" icon="shield-halved">
    Sentry node architecture with HSM key management and comprehensive monitoring
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational Excellence" icon="gear">
    24/7 monitoring, automated alerting, and documented disaster recovery procedures
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Validator Selection & Rotation

### Selection Process

When validator slots become available:

1. **Eligibility**: Must operate both mainnet and testnet nodes
2. **Prioritization**: Operators prioritized by reverse order of voting power (encouraging decentralization)
3. **Probation**: 3-month trial period with limited delegation
4. **Full Status**: Receive full DAO delegation after successful probation

### Rotation Framework

Validators may be rotated out for:

- **Performance Issues**: No rewards for 2 consecutive months or 3 months in 6-month period
- **Upgrade Delays**: Failure to resume signing within 60 minutes of upgrade or begin precommitting within 2 hours of instructions
- **Tombstoning**: Double-signing or critical security issues

## Mercury Upgrade

The Mercury upgrade in April 2025 marked a pivotal transition for Neutron, moving from Interchain Security (ICS) to a fully sovereign network. This enabled:

- Native NTRN staking with fixed supply tokenomics
- Performance improvements with reduced latency (~100ms) and increased throughput
- Better stability for the High Frequency Oracle and other infrastructure
- Faster upgrades and incident response capabilities
