title: "Validator Selection Criteria"
description: "Requirements for becoming a Neutron validator"
---

This document outlines the technical, operational, and community criteria for being selected as a Neutron validator following the Mercury upgrade.

## Neutron's Validator Set

Following the Mercury upgrade in April 2024, Neutron transitioned to a sovereign network with its own validator set structure:

- **Fixed Size**: The network is currently limited to 20 validators
- **Curated Selection**: Validators are selected based on proven performance and quality
- **DAO Delegation**: The Neutron DAO delegates significant NTRN to validators
- **Performance Focus**: Validators are specifically focused on infrastructure reliability

## Technical Requirements

Technical capability is the foundation of validator selection. Successful validators must demonstrate:

### Hardware Specifications

| Component | Minimum Requirement | Recommended |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| CPU | 4 cores / 8 threads | 8+ cores / 16+ threads |
| RAM | 32 GB | 64 GB+ |
| Storage | 1 TB NVMe SSD | 2 TB+ NVMe SSD |
| Network | 200 Mbps | 1 Gbps+ |

See our [System Specifications](/validators/technical/system-specs) page for detailed hardware requirements.

### Performance Requirements

Following the Mercury upgrade, validators must meet specific performance thresholds:

| Metric | Minimum Threshold | Target Threshold | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Block Signing | 95% (30-day average) | 99.5%+ | Affects compensation |
| Oracle Price Updates | 95% (30-day average) | 98%+ | Affects compensation |
| Upgrade Response | Resume signing within 60 min of first block | Immediate | Affects eligibility |
| Upgrade Preparation | Begin precommitting within 2 hrs of instructions | Immediate | Affects eligibility |

Validators who fail to meet minimum thresholds receive no compensation for the period, and repeated failures may result in rotation from the validator set.

### Infrastructure Design

- **Sentry Node Architecture**: Properly configured sentry nodes protecting validator nodes
- **High Availability**: Redundancy in critical systems
- **Disaster Recovery**: Documented recovery procedures and regular testing
- **Network Security**: Properly configured firewalls, VPNs, and network isolation

### Operational Excellence

- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of system health and performance
- **Alerting**: 24/7 alerting system for critical issues
- **Automation**: Automated processes for routine tasks and potential failures
- **Documentation**: Well-documented operational procedures
- **Incident Response**: Clear incident response procedures and post-mortems

### Security Practices

- **Key Management**: Secure storage and handling of validator keys
- **HSM Usage**: Hardware Security Modules for key operations (recommended)
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls and principle of least privilege
- **Patching**: Regular and timely system patching
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and penetration testing

## Validator Rotation Framework

After a one-month grace period following the Mercury upgrade, validators are subject to a formal rotation framework:

### Performance-Based Offboarding

A validator is considered for offboarding if any of the following conditions are met:

1. **Consecutive Performance Issues**:
   - Received no rewards from x/revenue for two consecutive months
   - Notified after the first month with assistance offered
   - Automatically flagged for rotation after the second consecutive month

2. **Intermittent Performance Issues**:
   - Received no rewards from x/revenue for three months in a 6-month period
   - Notified after the second month in the period
   - Automatically flagged for rotation after the third month in the period

3. **Tombstoning**:
   - Validator was tombstoned due to double-signing or critical security issues

### Downtime-Based Offboarding

A validator is considered for offboarding if either of these conditions are met:

1. **Resumption Latency**:
   - Failed to resume signing within 60 minutes of the first finalized block after an upgrade
   - Notified on first occurrence, marked for rotation on second occurrence

2. **Precommit Latency**:
   - Failed to begin precommitting within 2 hours of the distribution of upgrade instructions
   - Notified on first occurrence, marked for rotation on second occurrence

## Validator Onboarding Process

To join the active set when slots become available:

### Eligibility Requirements

1. **Network Participation**:
   - Must run both mainnet and testnet nodes
   - Must demonstrate technical capability and reliability

2. **Selection Priority**:
   - Validators are prioritized by reverse order of mainnet voting power
   - This encourages decentralization by favoring smaller validators

### Onboarding Procedure

1. **Initial Delegation**:
   - Selected operators receive a small delegation from the DAO
   - Sufficient to participate but limited to minimize risk

2. **Probation Period**:
   - Must demonstrate adequate performance for three consecutive months
   - Performance evaluated against the same metrics as existing validators

3. **Full Delegation**:
   - After successful probation, receive a full delegation from the DAO
   - Failure during probation results in redelegation to the next operator in line

## Community Contribution

While Neutron's validator model focuses specifically on infrastructure reliability, community contributions remain valuable:

### Development and Support

- **Documentation**: Contributing to technical documentation
- **Bug Reports**: Identifying and reporting issues
- **Community Support**: Assisting users and other validators

### Network Participation

- **Testnet Involvement**: Active participation in Neutron testnets
- **Upgrade Support**: Timely implementation of network upgrades
- **Crisis Response**: Effective coordination during network incidents

## Geographic Distribution

To enhance network resilience, validator geographic distribution is considered:

- **Jurisdictional Diversity**: Validators from different legal jurisdictions
- **Physical Distribution**: Physical location diversity to mitigate regional risks
- **Network Diversity**: Diverse network providers and data centers

## Transparency and Communication

Validators are expected to maintain clear communication channels:

- **Contact Information**: Accessible contact methods for urgent coordination
- **Maintenance Announcements**: Advance notice of planned maintenance
- **Incident Reporting**: Prompt reporting of any incidents or issues

## Application Process

The application process for becoming a validator when slots open includes:

1. **Technical Application**: Detailed information about technical setup
2. **Team Background**: Information about the team and track record
3. **Performance History**: Evidence of reliable operation on other networks
4. **Community Review**: Period of community feedback
5. **Selection Decision**: Final decision based on the criteria outlined above
