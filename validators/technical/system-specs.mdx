This document outlines the recommended system specifications for running a Neutron validator node in production.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Specifications

These are the minimum requirements to participate in the Neutron network. Nodes with these specifications may struggle during high network load.

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| CPU | 4 cores / 8 threads |
| RAM | 16 GB DDR4 |
| Storage | 500 GB SSD |
| Network | 100 Mbps |

### Recommended Specifications

For optimal performance and future-proofing, we recommend the following:

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| CPU | 8+ cores / 16+ threads (AMD Ryzen or Intel Xeon) |
| RAM | 32 GB+ DDR4 |
| Storage | 2 TB+ NVMe SSD |
| Network | 500+ Mbps with 5 TB+ monthly bandwidth |

### Storage Considerations

Fast storage is critical for validator performance. We recommend:

- NVMe SSDs for the best performance
- Enterprise-grade SSDs with high durability (DWPD)
- Separate drives for the operating system and blockchain data
- RAID configurations for improved reliability

## Software Requirements

### Operating System

| OS | Version | Notes |
|----|---------|-------|
| Ubuntu | 22.04 LTS or higher | Recommended for most validators |
| Debian | 11 or higher | Alternative option |
| CentOS | 9 or higher | For those familiar with RHEL-based systems |

We recommend using a minimal server installation with only necessary packages to reduce the attack surface.

### Software Dependencies

The following software packages should be installed:

- Go 1.21 or higher
- gcc and build tools
- jq (for JSON parsing)
- Supervisor or systemd (for service management)
- Prometheus and Node Exporter (for monitoring)

## Network Configuration

### Firewall Rules

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Allow From |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 22 | TCP | SSH | Restricted IPs only |
| 26656 | TCP | P2P | Public |
| 26657 | TCP | RPC | Localhost or restricted IPs |
| 1317 | TCP | API | Localhost or restricted IPs |
| 9090 | TCP | gRPC | Localhost or restricted IPs |
| 9091 | TCP | gRPC-web | Localhost or restricted IPs |

### Sentry Node Architecture

For production validators, we recommend a sentry node architecture:

```
Internet <-> Sentry Nodes <-> Private Network <-> Validator
```

This setup protects your validator node from direct exposure to the public internet.

## Cloud vs. Self-Hosted

Both cloud and self-hosted deployments have advantages:

### Cloud Providers

Suitable options include:
- AWS (m6i.2xlarge or higher)
- Google Cloud (n2-standard-8 or higher)
- Digital Ocean (Premium CPU-Optimized droplets)
- Hetzner (Dedicated servers or cloud instances)

**Pros:**
- Easier management
- Built-in redundancy
- DDoS protection

**Cons:**
- Higher long-term cost
- Less control
- Potential centralization concerns

### Self-Hosted

**Pros:**
- Lower long-term cost
- Full control over hardware
- Better for network decentralization

**Cons:**
- Requires physical access and maintenance
- Needs reliable power and internet
- More complex backup solutions

## Monitoring and Alerts

Essential monitoring components:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Node Exporter for system metrics
- Alertmanager for notifications

Key metrics to monitor:
- Validator missed blocks
- Disk usage
- CPU and memory usage
- Network connections
- Validator status

## High Availability Setup

For critical validators, consider:

- Automated failover to backup nodes
- Geographically distributed infrastructure
- Redundant internet connections
- Uninterruptible power supplies
- Hot standby nodes
