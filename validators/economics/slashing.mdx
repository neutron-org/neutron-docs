title: "Validator Penalties"
description: "Understanding Neutron's no-slashing model and validator accountability"
---

Neutron implements a unique approach to validator accountability that differs significantly from traditional Proof of Stake networks. Following the Mercury upgrade, this model has been formalized and enhanced.

## Neutron's No-Slashing Model

Unlike most Cosmos chains, Neutron implements a **no-slashing model**. This means:

- Validators and delegators are **not penalized with stake reduction** for downtime
- Double-signing does not result in automatic stake slashing
- Missing blocks does not trigger automatic financial penalties

Instead, Neutron uses alternative mechanisms to ensure network security and validator performance.

## Jailing and Tombstoning Mechanisms

While Neutron doesn't slash, it employs other protective measures:

### Jailing

Validators may be jailed (temporarily suspended from the active set) for:

- **Excessive Downtime**: Missing too many blocks in a defined window
- **Upgrade Failures**: Not implementing upgrades correctly or promptly
- **Performance Issues**: Consistently failing to meet performance thresholds

Jailed validators:
- Cannot participate in consensus
- Cannot earn rewards
- Must undergo an unjailing process to resume validation

### Tombstoning

For more serious offenses, validators may be tombstoned:

- **Double-Signing**: Signing conflicting blocks at the same height
- **Repeated Jailing**: Multiple jailing events in a short timeframe
- **Security Breaches**: Compromised validator keys or infrastructure

Tombstoned validators:
- Are permanently removed from the current active set
- Must establish a new validator identity to participate again
- Are flagged for potential rotation in the validator set

## Performance-Based Offboarding

Post-Mercury upgrade, Neutron implements formal offboarding criteria:

### Performance-Based Criteria

A validator is considered for offboarding if:
- They receive no compensation from x/revenue for two consecutive months
- They receive no compensation from x/revenue for three months in a 6-month period
- They are tombstoned

### Downtime-Based Criteria

A validator is considered for offboarding if:
- They fail to resume signing within 60 minutes of the first finalized block after an upgrade
- They fail to begin precommitting within 2 hours of the distribution of upgrade instructions

## Warning and Notification System

The offboarding process includes a structured warning system:

1. **First Notification**: Validators are notified about performance issues
2. **Assistance Phase**: Core teams assist in troubleshooting any issues
3. **Final Warning**: Clear communication about impending offboarding if issues persist
4. **Offboarding Decision**: Final determination through the DAO governance process

## Validator Rotation Process

When validators are offboarded, new validators may join through a structured process:

1. **Eligibility Assessment**: Validators must run both mainnet and testnet nodes
2. **Initial Delegation**: Selected validators receive a small initial delegation
3. **Probation Period**: Three-month period to demonstrate adequate performance
4. **Full Delegation**: Successful validators receive a full delegation from the DAO

## Why No Slashing?

Neutron's approach offers several advantages:

1. **Lower Risk for Delegators**: Delegators don't face the risk of losing funds due to validator mistakes
2. **Broader Participation**: Lower risk encourages greater staking participation
3. **Focus on Quality**: Selection based on quality rather than penalty avoidance
4. **Delegator Protection**: Reduces the risk that delegators lose funds due to validator errors
5. **Upgrade Safety**: Encourages validators to be more responsive during network upgrades

## Comparison with Traditional Slashing

| Aspect | Traditional Slashing | Neutron's Model |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Downtime Penalty | Loss of stake (e.g., 0.01-1%) | Jailing without stake loss |
| Double-Sign Penalty | Severe stake loss (e.g., 5-100%) | Tombstoning without stake loss |
| Recovery | Difficult to recover after slashing | Focus on improvement or validator rotation |
| Delegator Risk | Delegators lose funds for validator mistakes | Delegators protected from direct losses |
| Security Model | Cryptoeconomic penalties | Curation, incentives, and rotation |

## Validator Responsibilities

Despite the absence of slashing, validators still have important responsibilities:

- **Maintain High Performance**: Meet or exceed the required block signing (99.5%) and price update (98%) thresholds
- **Prevent Double-Signing**: Implement proper key management and signer redundancy
- **Upgrade Readiness**: Prepare for and execute network upgrades promptly
- **Security Best Practices**: Follow security recommendations to protect the network

## Delegator Considerations

For delegators, Neutron's approach means:

- **Reduced Risk**: No direct financial loss from validator mistakes
- **Consistent Returns**: Target 3% APR regardless of validator selection
- **Importance of Research**: Still valuable to choose validators with strong technical capabilities

## Governance and Evolution

The validator accountability system falls under DAO governance and may evolve:

- **Parameter Changes**: Modifying jailing thresholds or performance requirements
- **New Mechanisms**: Introducing additional quality assurance systems
- **Validator Set Size**: Potential changes to the number of active validators
- **Performance Metrics**: Refinement of what metrics are used to evaluate validators
