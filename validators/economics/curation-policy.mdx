title: "Validator Curation Policy"
description: "Understanding how validators are selected and maintained in the Neutron network"
---

Neutron's validator set is carefully curated to ensure network security, performance, and alignment with ecosystem values. This document explains the curation policy and process.

## Core Principles

Neutron's validator curation is based on several key principles:

1. **Merit-Based Selection**: Validators are chosen based on their technical expertise, contribution to the ecosystem, and reliability
2. **Decentralization**: The validator set should be geographically and operationally diverse
3. **Transparency**: Selection criteria and processes are open and visible to all
4. **Community Governance**: The community has ultimate authority over validator set composition

## Selection Criteria

### Technical Requirements

Validators must meet or exceed these technical standards:

- **Hardware**: Sufficient CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity
- **Uptime**: Demonstrated ability to maintain high uptime (99.5%+)
- **Security**: Strong key management practices and security measures
- **Architecture**: Proper sentry node setup and network design
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems

### Community Contribution

Validators are expected to contribute to the ecosystem:

- **Documentation**: Contribute to technical documentation and guides
- **Code**: Provide bug reports, fixes, or features to core software
- **Education**: Create educational content or tools for the community
- **Support**: Offer support in community channels
- **Network Participation**: Active participation in testnets and upgrades

### Business Conduct

Validators must demonstrate professional conduct:

- **Transparency**: Clear communication about operations and commission changes
- **Responsiveness**: Prompt response to network issues or governance matters
- **Ethics**: Avoiding conflicts of interest or harmful practices
- **Compliance**: Following applicable regulations in their jurisdictions

## Curation Process

### Initial Selection

The initial validator set is selected through:

1. **Application Process**: Prospective validators submit applications with detailed information
2. **Technical Evaluation**: Review of technical setup and capabilities
3. **Community Review**: Public review and feedback period
4. **Governance Decision**: Final approval through governance process

### Ongoing Evaluation

Validators are continuously evaluated based on:

- **Performance Metrics**: Block production, voting participation, response time
- **Community Feedback**: Input from delegators and community members
- **Contribution Tracking**: Ongoing contributions to the ecosystem
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic comprehensive reviews of all validators

### Removal Process

Validators may be removed from the active set for:

- **Persistent Underperformance**: Consistent failure to meet minimum performance standards
- **Security Incidents**: Significant security breaches or double-signing
- **Harmful Behavior**: Actions detrimental to the network or community
- **Inactivity**: Extended periods without participation in governance or community

The removal process typically involves:

1. **Warning**: Initial notification of concerns
2. **Improvement Period**: Time to address issues (when applicable)
3. **Governance Proposal**: Community vote on removal
4. **Execution**: Implementation of removal decision

## Validator Set Parameters

### Set Size

- **Current Size**: [Current validator set size]
- **Maximum Size**: [Maximum validator set size]
- **Adjustment Process**: Changes to set size require governance approval

### Delegation Caps

To maintain decentralization, Neutron implements:

- **Soft Caps**: Guidelines for maximum stake concentration
- **Visibility Tools**: Clear indicators of stake distribution
- **Education**: Community guidance on delegation best practices

## Incentivizing Good Behavior

In the absence of slashing, Neutron uses positive incentives:

- **Performance-Based Rewards**: Additional rewards for exceptional performance
- **Visibility**: Recognition and promotion of exemplary validators
- **Delegation Guidance**: Tools to help delegators identify high-quality validators

## Geographic Distribution

Geographic diversity is encouraged through:

- **Region Tracking**: Monitoring of validator geographic distribution
- **Diversity Incentives**: Programs to encourage validators in underrepresented regions
- **Risk Analysis**: Evaluation of geographic concentration risks

## Governance Role

The governance system's role in curation includes:

- **Parameter Setting**: Determining key parameters of the curation system
- **Dispute Resolution**: Addressing conflicts or unclear situations
- **Process Updates**: Modifying the curation process as needed
- **Final Authority**: Making final decisions on validator admission and removal

## Future Directions

The curation policy may evolve to include:

- **Automated Metrics**: More advanced automated validator performance tracking
- **Reputation Systems**: Formalized reputation scores for validators
- **Specialized Committees**: Dedicated groups focused on validator evaluation
- **Tiered System**: Different tiers of validators with different requirements and rewards
