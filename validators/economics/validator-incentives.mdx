Following the Mercury upgrade, Neutron implemented a unique validator economic model that fundamentally differs from traditional Proof of Stake networks. This page explains how validator compensation, delegator rewards, and the overall economic incentives work.

## Neutron's Distinct Economic Model

## Validator Compensation

Neutron's validator compensation mechanism is designed to provide predictable income to validators while ensuring the network doesn't overpay for security during bull markets or underpay during bear markets.

### Base Compensation

The `x/revenue` module, a specialized component in Neutron's blockchain, handles validator compensation:

- **Target Amount:** $3,000 USD per month per validator
- **Payment Schedule:** Monthly distribution
- **Token Calculation:** The module uses the network's oracle to convert the USD target amount to the appropriate number of NTRN tokens
- **Source:** All payments come directly from the Neutron DAO Treasury

<Note>
  The base compensation amount is a parameter that can be adjusted by DAO governance to reflect changes in market conditions or validator requirements.
</Note>

### Performance-Based Adjustments

Compensation is directly tied to validator performance across two key metrics:

<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  <table className="min-w-full divide-y divide-gray-200 dark:divide-gray-700">
    <thead className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800">
      <tr>
        <th className="px-6 py-3 text-left text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300 uppercase tracking-wider">Performance Range</th>
        <th className="px-6 py-3 text-left text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300 uppercase tracking-wider">Block Signing</th>

      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 divide-y divide-gray-200 dark:divide-gray-700">
      <tr>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">Above threshold</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">≥ 99.5%</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">≥ 98%</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">Full rewards</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">Medium range</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">95% - 99.5%</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">95% - 98%</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">Partial rewards</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">Below minimum</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">< 95%</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">< 95%</td>
        <td className="px-6 py-4 whitespace-nowrap">No rewards</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<Tip>
  Both criteria must be met to receive the corresponding reward level. If a validator fails to meet the minimum threshold for any criteria, they receive no reward for the period, regardless of their performance in the other criterion.
</Tip>

## Delegator Rewards

Delegator staking rewards follow a completely separate mechanism from validator compensation:

- **Target APR:** Approximately 3% annually
- **Payment Source:** Neutron DAO Treasury
- **Distribution:** Direct to delegators based on their staked amount
- **Mechanism:** Independent system that doesn't rely on validator commission splits

This system ensures delegators receive consistent returns regardless of individual validator performance (as long as the validator remains in the active set).

## The Role of the DAO Treasury

The Neutron DAO Treasury plays a central role in the economic model:

### Treasury Responsibilities

  </Card>
  <Card title="Ecosystem Development" icon="seedling" iconType="duotone">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Treasury Management

The DAO maintains approximately 22.5% of the NTRN token supply delegated through the Drop Protocol. This serves several purposes:

1. Protecting the network from economic attacks
2. Facilitating ongoing delegation management 
3. Supporting liquid staking through dNTRN
4. Creating deep liquidity for NTRN and dNTRN tokens

## No Slashing Model

Unlike traditional Proof of Stake networks, Neutron does not implement slashing:

<div className="p-4 border-l-4 border-blue-500 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900 dark:bg-opacity-20 my-4">
  <p><strong>Why No Slashing?</strong> Traditional slashing disproportionately impacts delegators rather than the misbehaving operators. It also disincentivizes validators from being reactive during network upgrades when slashing risk is highest.</p>
</div>

Instead, Neutron uses three alternative mechanisms:

1. **Jailing:** Temporarily removing validators from the active set for minor infractions
2. **Tombstoning:** Permanently removing validators for serious violations like double-signing
3. **Rotation:** Replacing underperforming validators through the structured rotation framework

This approach protects delegators while still maintaining strong incentives for validator performance.

## Liquid Staking Integration

The network actively encourages the development and adoption of liquid staking:

- The DAO delegates a large portion of its treasury through Drop Protocol
- This creates a significant supply of dNTRN (the liquid staked derivative token)
- The DAO helps bootstrap dNTRN liquidity in DeFi protocols
- Users can utilize dNTRN across the ecosystem while still earning staking rewards
