Following the Mercury upgrade, Neutron implemented a unique validator economic model that fundamentally differs from traditional Proof of Stake networks. This page explains how validator compensation, delegator rewards, and the overall economic incentives work.

## Neutron's Distinct Economic Model

Neutron's economic model introduces several key differences from traditional Proof of Stake networks:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fixed Supply" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
    NTRN remains a fixed-supply asset with no inflation-based block rewards
  </Card>
  <Card title="DAO Treasury Funding" icon="building-columns" iconType="duotone">
    All rewards are paid by the Neutron DAO Treasury rather than through inflation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Base Compensation" icon="money-bill" iconType="duotone">
    Validators receive stable monthly compensation for meeting performance requirements
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Slashing" icon="shield-check" iconType="duotone">
    Uses jailing, tombstoning, and validator rotation instead of slashing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Validator Compensation

Neutron's validator compensation mechanism provides predictable income while ensuring the network maintains optimal security economics.

### Base Compensation Structure

The `x/revenue` module handles validator compensation:

- **Target Amount:** $3,000 USD per month per validator
- **Payment Schedule:** Monthly distribution
- **Token Calculation:** Uses network oracle to convert USD to NTRN tokens
- **Source:** Neutron DAO Treasury

<Note>
  The base compensation amount is a governance parameter that can be adjusted by DAO vote to reflect market conditions or validator requirements.
</Note>

### Performance-Based Rewards

Compensation is tied to validator performance across two key metrics:

| Performance Range | Block Signing | Oracle Updates | Reward Level |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Full Rewards** | 99.5% or higher | 98% or higher | 100% of base compensation |
| **Partial Rewards** | 95% - 99.5% | 95% - 98% | Proportional compensation |
| **No Rewards** | Below 95% | Below 95% | Zero compensation |

<Tip>
  Both criteria must be met to receive the corresponding reward level. Failing either metric results in no rewards for that period.
</Tip>

## Delegator Rewards

Delegator staking rewards operate independently from validator compensation:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Target APR" icon="percentage">
    Approximately 3% annually for all delegators
  </Card>
  <Card title="Payment Source" icon="building-columns">
    Distributed directly from Neutron DAO Treasury
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="chart-line">
    Returns independent of individual validator performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This system ensures delegators receive consistent returns regardless of individual validator performance, as long as the validator remains in the active set.

## Treasury Responsibilities

The Neutron DAO Treasury manages multiple aspects of network economics:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Validator Payments" icon="money-bill-transfer" iconType="duotone">
    Monthly compensation distribution based on performance metrics
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delegator Rewards" icon="hand-holding-dollar" iconType="duotone">
    Funds the delegator reward system targeting 3% APR
  </Card>
  <Card title="Network Security" icon="shield" iconType="duotone">
    Maintains significant self-delegation to protect against economic attacks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ecosystem Growth" icon="seedling" iconType="duotone">
    Supports protocol development and ecosystem expansion
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Treasury Self-Delegation

The DAO maintains approximately 22.5% of the NTRN token supply delegated through the Drop Protocol, which:

- Protects the network from economic attacks
- Facilitates liquid staking through dNTRN
- Creates deep liquidity for NTRN and dNTRN tokens
- Supports ongoing delegation management

## No Slashing Model

Neutron eliminates traditional slashing to protect delegators and encourage validator responsiveness during critical network operations.

**Alternative Enforcement Mechanisms:**

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Jailing" icon="lock">
    Temporarily removes validators from active set for minor infractions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tombstoning" icon="ban">
    Permanently removes validators for serious violations like double-signing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Replaces underperforming validators through structured framework
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This approach protects delegators while maintaining strong performance incentives for validators.

## Liquid Staking Integration

Neutron actively promotes liquid staking adoption:

- DAO delegates treasury through Drop Protocol
- Creates significant dNTRN (liquid staked derivative) supply
- DAO bootstraps dNTRN liquidity in DeFi protocols
- Users can utilize dNTRN across ecosystem while earning staking rewards
