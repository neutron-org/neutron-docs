# Integration tests for chain

There is a set of integration tests which cover main Neutron features. If you're developing a smart contract for Neutron or working on a Neutron module, you can add some tests into this set to make sure everything works as expected.

However, if you're working on a smart contract, there's a more elegant way to write tests for it. See the [integration tests for smart contracts](/tutorials/integration-tests/smart_contracts) tutorial for details.

* [Running the tests](#Running-the-tests)
* [Environment variables](#Environment-variables-you-can-redefine)
* [Creating your own tests](#Creating-your-own-tests)

## Installation
* `git clone git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron-integration-tests.git`
* `git clone -b v3.0.2 git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron.git`
* `git clone -b v0.2.0 git@github.com:neutron-org/neutron-query-relayer.git`
* `git clone -b v15.0.0 git@github.com:cosmos/gaia.git`
* `cd neutron-integration-tests`
* \* `make -C setup build-all`
* `yarn`
* Make sure you have docker installed and docker daemon running

\* Only for the first run, to build hermes ibc relayer and gaiad containers

## Running the tests

```
yarn test # all tests
yarn test:simple # basic tests
yarn test:interchaintx # interchain txs test
yarn test:interchain_tx_query_plain # interchain tx query test
yarn test:interchain_tx_query_resubmit # interchain tx query test #2
yarn test:interchain_kv_query # interchain kv query test
```
## Environment variables you can redefine

```
APP_DIR - applications directory where Neutron, Gaia and Neutron query relayer are located
NEUTRON_DENOM - neutron network denom
COSMOS_DENOM - gaia (cosmoshub) network denom
IBC_ATOM_DENOM — denom of a native token which is used as a fake IBC transferred ATOM
IBC_USDC_DENOM — denom of a native token which is used as a fake IBC transferred USDC
CONTRACTS_PATH - path to contracts that will be used in tests
NEUTRON_ADDRESS_PREFIX - address prefix for neutron controller network
COSMOS_ADDRESS_PREFIX - address prefix for gaia (cosmoshub) host network
NODE1_URL - url to the first node
NODE1_WS_URL - url to websocket of the first node
NODE2_URL - url to the second node
NODE2_WS_URL - url to websocket of the second node
BLOCKS_COUNT_BEFORE_START - how many blocks we wait before start first test
NO_DOCKER - do not start cosmopark for tests
NO_REBUILD - skip containers rebuilding
```

## Creating your own tests
### Creating your contract
To create a new contract you can refer to [Neutron Cosmwasm SDK Repo](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk) to have an idea how to use Neutron SDK.

### Updating artifacts
You'll need to update artifacts in `./contracts` folder in case you have created a new contract. Place your contract(s) into `./contracts/artifacts` folder. Let's say you have the contract  with name `my_contract.wasm`

### Your first test
Create a file named `new_one.test.ts` in `./src/testcases/parallel` with following code:
```js
import { TestStateLocalCosmosTestNet } from './common_localcosmosnet';
import {
  NEUTRON_DENOM,
  CosmosWrapper,
  WalletWrapper,
} from '../../helpers/cosmos';

describe('Neutron / My test', () => {
  let testState: TestStateLocalCosmosTestNet;
  let neutronChain: CosmosWrapper;
  let neutronAccount: WalletWrapper;
  let codeId: string;
  let contractAddress: string;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    testState = new TestStateLocalCosmosTestNet();
    await testState.init();

    neutronChain = new CosmosWrapper(
      testState.sdk1,
      testState.blockWaiter1,
      NEUTRON_DENOM,
    );
    neutronAccount = new WalletWrapper(
      neutronChain,
      testState.wallets.qaNeutron.genQaWal1,
    );
  });

  test('store contract', async () => {
    codeId = await neutronAccount.storeWasm('my_contract.wasm');
    expect(codeId).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
  test('instantiate', async () => {
    const res = await neutronAccount.instantiateContract(
      codeId,
      '{}',
      'my_contract',
    );
    contractAddress = res[0]._contract_address;
    expect(contractAddress).toStartWith('neutron');
  });
  test('execute contract', async () => {
    const res = await neutronAccount.executeContract(
      contractAddress,
      JSON.stringify({
        my_method: {
          //we assume you have this method in the contract
          foo: 'bar',
        },
      }),
    );
    expect(res.code).toEqual(0);
  });
});

```

> Warning: Use `src/testcases/run_in_band` folder for your test if it cannot be run in parallel!
> This is usually the case if test mutates some global chain state that other tests use directly or indirectly.

Then update `package.json` in the root folder. Like this
```
...
    "test:new_one": "jest --runInBand -b src/testcases/parallel/new_one",
...
```
Now you can run your test:
```bash
yarn test:new_one
```
