# Neutron standalone docker

This page contains information about building and running a Neutron node in a standalone way.

## Prerequisites

- Docker engine;
- Golang v1.22 ([go releases and instructions](https://go.dev/dl/)).

## Build and run

### 1. Make sure you have the required golang version

```sh
go version
```

The output should comply with the golang version mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

### 2. Clone Neutron core repository and cd into it

```sh
git clone -b main https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git
cd neutron
```

### 3. Build a Neutron node image

```sh
make build-docker-image
```

### 4. Run a Neutron node as a docker container

```sh
make start-docker-container
```

A Neutron node is now running in the background. To see the app logs, run:

```sh
docker ps
```

And use the `neutron-node` container ID in the following command:

```sh
docker logs -f <neutron-node-contained-id>
```

To stop the node, run

```sh
make stop-docker-container
```

## Usage

### Ports

The Neutron node exposes several ports to be used by you and your applications:
- 1317:1317 — the REST server;
- 26657:26657 — the Tendermint RPC server;
- 26656:26656 — the Tendermint P2P server;
- 9090:8090 — the gRPC server.

### Interaction with the node using neutrond

The Neutron node is available to be interacted with using `neutrond` command. The following command will install `neutrond` at your computer:

```sh
make install
```

It will build the `neutrond` based on the current version of the Neutron core and place the result binary to your `GOBIN` directory. Make sure `GOBIN` is defined and is a part of the `PATH` env variable. If you have any troubles at this step, try to shoot them by verifying you have the golang related env variables set properly.

Once installation is done, the `neutrond` is ready to be used:

```sh
neutrond query bank total
```

### Making transactions

There are several accounts added at the genesis state that possess NTRN and are at your service. See the [genesis init script](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/blob/main/network/init.sh) to find out more details about it. The following command will list you all the preallocated addresses:

```sh
docker exec <neutron-node-contained-id> neutrond keys list --keyring-backend test --home data/test-1/
```

We suggest you to add the accounts from the init script mentioned above to your local test keyring to make them useful directly from command line. To do so, copy a mnemonic from the script and use it in a keypair recovery procedure:

```sh
neutrond keys add <name> --recover --keyring-backend test
> Enter your bip39 mnemonic
```

After that, you'll be able to make transactions on behalf of the account and fund your applications and smart contracts.
