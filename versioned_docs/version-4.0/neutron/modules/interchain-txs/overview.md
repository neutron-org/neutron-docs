# Overview

This document specifies the Interchain Transactions module for the Neutron network.

The Interchain Transactions module manages the creation of IBC Accounts and executing interchain transactions on behalf
of CosmWasm smart contracts. The current implementation allows a smart contract to:

1. Register multiple interchain accounts on a remote zone using an existing IBC connection;
2. Execute transactions with multiple messages on a remote zone;
3. Process the `OnChanOpenAck`, `Acknowledgement` and `Timeout` events as they are delivered by a relayer.

## IBC events

Registering an interchain account or executing an interchain transaction are asynchronous actions. In most cases, the
respective handlers of the Interchain Transactions module immediately return an empty successful response. The "real"
response (with information about the status of execution on a remote zone) is later delivered in a separate IBC packet
by a relayer. We call such packets the **IBC events**.

A smart contract that tries to register an interchain account or to execute an interchain transaction naturally expects
to receive the IBC events related to these actions. The Interchain Transactions module solves this task by passing these
IBC events to the smart contract using
a [Sudo() call](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/288609255ad92dfe5c54eae572fe7d6010e712eb/x/wasm/keeper/keeper.go#L453)
and a custom [message scheme](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/blob/main/x/contractmanager/types/sudo.go). You can find a
complete list of IBC events for each module message in the [messages](./messages) section.

## Sudo errors handling

Interchaintxs module configured the following way, all the errors from a sudo handler are being suppressed by [contract manager middleware](/neutron/modules/contract-manager/overview#sudolimitwrapper), sudo handler is limited with [LIMIT](/neutron/modules/contract-manager/overview#gas-limitation) amount of gas

## Importing interchaintxs module

If you use interchaintxs module in your application and if your Sudo handler fails, the acknowledgment will be marked as processed inside the IBC module anyway, without any notes about an error saved into the store. This will make the IBC relayers to successfully submit the acknowledgment and get the fees.

> **Note** You can use a [contracts manager](/neutron/modules/contract-manager/overview#concepts) SudoLimitWrapper as a wrapper for SudoKeeper,
> exactly like neutron [configured](#sudo-errors-handling) the module
>
> **Note** We strongly recommend developers to write Sudo handlers very carefully and keep them as simple as possible. If you do
> want to have elaborate logic in your handler, you should verify the acknowledgement data before making any state
> changes; that way you can, if the data received with the acknowledgement is incompatible with executing the handler
> logic normally, return an `Ok()` response immediately, which will prevent the acknowledgement from being resubmitted
>

## Sudo Handlers

The interchaintxs module in neutrond configured the following way.

Wasmd Sudo handler wrapped with [SudoLimitWrapper](../contract-manager/overview.md#sudolimitwrapper)

And acknoledgement packet follows the way
`OnAcknowledgementPacket` --> [SudoLimitWrapper](../contract-manager/overview.md#sudolimitwrapper) --> `Wasmd Sudo handler`

Using `SudoLimitWrapper` has two purposes:

1. Suppress the sudo handler error itself, and mark the ibc acknowledgement packet as received and processed. Other way, the error makes relayer send an acknowledgement again and again. Information about an unsuccessfully processed ack is stored in [state](../contract-manager/state.md).
2. Limit the amount of gas available for sudo handler execution. Out of gas panic will later be captured by `SudoLimitWrapper` and converted into an error.

## Failed interchain txs

Not every interchaintx executes succesfully on a remote network. Some of them fail to execute with errors and then you get ibc acknowledgement with `Error` type. The error is passed into the caller contract via sudo call with SudoMsg::Error [variant](../../../tutorials/cosmwasm_ica.md#ibc-events)

Unfortunately, to avoid the nondeterminism associated with error text generation, the error text is severely truncated by [redact down](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v7.3.1/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/host/ibc_module.go#L115) to the error code without any additional details, before converting into AcknowledgementError.

Find the error text is possible if host chain includes ibc-go v7.2.3+, v7.3.2+, v8.0.1+, v8.1+ which include patch [5541](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/pull/5541)
`<binary> q interchain-accounts host packet-events <channel-id> <seq-id>`

Where:

- `binary` is a binary on the chain you are working with (the remote chain)
- `seq-id` - sequence ID of the IBC message sent to the remote chain. The seq-id is returned to the contract in the [SubmitTx](./messages.md#response) response
- `channel-id` is the ID of the ICA's channel on the remote chain's side. You should know it from registration [procedure](../../../tutorials/cosmwasm_ica.md#2-register-an-interchain-account) via `SudoMsg::OpenAck` from `counterparty_channel_id` field. If you missed it you can always get counterparty channel-id with CLI command `neutrond q ibc channel end <src-port> <src-channel-id>`
- `src-channel-id` is the channel you intechain account associated with.
- `src-port` is the port you interchain account is associated with.
You should know both `src-channel-id` and `src-port` from registration [procedure](../../../tutorials/cosmwasm_ica.md#2-register-an-interchain-account). Also `src-port` is `icacontroller-<contract_address>.<ica_id>` where `ica_id` defined by you during ica registration.

Output example (filtered events):

```json
{
"type": "ibccallbackerror-ics27_packet",
"attributes": [
    {
    "key": "ibccallbackerror-module",
    "value": "interchainaccounts",
    "index": true
    },
    {
    "key": "ibccallbackerror-host_channel_id",
    "value": "channel-2",
    "index": true
    },
    {
    "key": "ibccallbackerror-success",
    "value": "false",
    "index": true
    },
    {
    "key": "ibccallbackerror-error",
    "value": "invalid validator address: decoding bech32 failed: invalid separator index -1: invalid address",
    "index": true
    }
]
}
```

On earlier versions of ibc-go it's barely possible to get full text error due to [patch](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/commit/fdbb508c1ca68811206d7175fb9e202c1611a43e).

In the IBC error acknowledgement you get ABCI error and a code, e.g. `codespace: wasm, code: 5`
where codespace usually is `ModuleName`, and `code` is uniq code for the module. `codespace` and `code` pair uniq for the whole app. You can find the error description in source code. Usualy all the error of the module are [placed](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/blob/5f444cd9d393513e534cbfa9a0e938295c4e84e1/x/wasm/types/errors.go#L25) in `x/<module>/types/errors.go` where `module` is the module where the error was thrown

## Relaying

Neutron introduces smart-contract level callbacks for IBC packets. From an IBC relayer's perspective, this means that
custom application logic can be executed when a packet is submitted to Neutron, which can potentially drain the
relayer's funds. This naturally brings us to a situation in which protocols would prefer to set up their own relayers
and restrict the channels they are willing to relay for. For example,
in [Hermes](https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs) you can do this by adding a `chains.packet_filter` config:

```toml
[chains.packet_filter]
policy = 'allow'
list = [
    # allow relaying only for chanels created by a certain contract
    ['icacontroller-neutron14hj2tavq8fpesdwxxcu44rty3hh90vhujrvcmstl4zr3txmfvw9s5c2epq*', '*'],
]
```

> Note: you can have a look at the `MsgRegisterInterchainQuery` documentation in the [Messages](messages.md) chapter
> to learn how IBC port naming works.

Please refer to the [IBC Relaying](../../../relaying/ibc-relayer.md) section for full IBC relaying documentation.
