# CosmWasm + ICA

This section contains a tutorial for writing smart contracts that utilize interchain accounts.

## Overview

We are going to learn how to:

1. Install dependencies and import the libraries;
2. Register an Interchain Account;
3. Execute an interchain transaction.

> **Note:** Neutron provides an implementation of an ICA
> controller [module](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/tree/main/x/interchaintxs), which simplifies the creation
> and
> management of interchain accounts for smart contract developers. This module, however, is not your only option; you
> can
> use raw IBC packets to imitate
> the [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts) implementation, or use
> a framework that already implements the same logic on smart contracts level.

> **Note:** this section assumes that you have basic knowledge of CosmWasm and have some experience in writing smart
> contracts. You can check out CosmWasm [docs](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs)
> and [blog posts](https://medium.com/cosmwasm/writing-a-cosmwasm-contract-8fb946c3a516) for entry-level tutorials.

## The complete example

In the snippets below some details might be omitted. Please check out the complete smart contract
[example](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk/tree/main/contracts/neutron_interchain_txs) for a complete
implementation.

## 1. Install dependencies and import the libraries

In order to start using the Neutron ICA controller module, you need to install some dependencies. Add the following
libraries to your dependencies section:

```toml
[dependencies]
cosmwasm-std = "1.2.5"

# Other standard dependencies...

# This is a library that simplifies working with IBC response packets (acknowledgments, timeouts),
# contains bindings for the Neutron ICA adapter module (messages, responses, etc.) and provides
# various helper functions.
neutron-sdk = "0.5.0"

# Required to marshal skd.Msg values; the marshalled messages will be attached to the IBC packets
# and executed as a transaction on the host chain.
cosmos-sdk-proto = { version = "0.14.0", default-features = false }
protobuf = { version = "3.2.0", features = ["with-bytes"] }
```

Now you can import the libraries:

```rust
use neutron_sdk::{
    bindings::{
        msg::{IbcFee, MsgSubmitTxResponse, NeutronMsg},
        query::{NeutronQuery, QueryInterchainAccountAddressResponse},
        types::ProtobufAny,
    },
    interchain_txs::helpers::{
        decode_acknowledgement_response, decode_message_response, get_port_id,
    },
    sudo::msg::{RequestPacket, SudoMsg},
    NeutronResult,
};
use cosmwasm_std::Coin;
```

## 2. Register an Interchain Account

Neutron allows a smart contract to register multiple interchain account for within a single IBC connection. While you
can implement interchain account registration in the `instantiate()` entrypoint, having a separate handler is probably a
better idea:

```rust
// Initialize the storage for known interchain accounts.
pub const INTERCHAIN_ACCOUNTS: Map<String, Option<(String, String)>> =
    Map::new("interchain_accounts");

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Register {
        connection_id: String,
        interchain_account_id: String,
    }
}

#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    _: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response<NeutronMsg>> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Register {
            connection_id,
            interchain_account_id,
        } => execute_register_ica(deps, env, connection_id, interchain_account_id),
    }
}

fn execute_register_ica(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    connection_id: String,
    interchain_account_id: String,
) -> StdResult<Response<NeutronMsg>> {
    let register =
        NeutronMsg::register_interchain_account(connection_id, interchain_account_id.clone());

    // Get the IBC port identifier generated by Neutron for the new interchain account.
    let key = get_port_id(env.contract.address.as_str(), &interchain_account_id);

    // Add an incomplete entry for the new account to the storage.
    INTERCHAIN_ACCOUNTS.save(deps.storage, key, &None)?;
    Ok(Response::new().add_message(register))
}
```

In the snippet above, we create the `ExecuteMsg` enum that contains the `Register` message, and implement a
simple `execute_register_ica()` handler for this message. This handler:

1. Creates a message to the Neutrons `interchaintxs` module;
2. Uses a helper function `get_port_id()` to get the port identifier that Neutron is going to generate for the channel
   dedicated to this specific interchain account;
3. Initializes the storage for information related to the new interchain account (currently empty).

The `interchain_account_id` is just a string name for your new account that you can use to distinguish between multiple
accounts created within a single IBC connection.

> **Note:** in a real-world scenario you wouldn't want just anyone to be able to make your contract register interchain
> accounts, so it might make sense to check the handler

After executing the `execute_register_ica()` handler you need to have a way to know whether the account was registered
properly. As with all IBÐ¡-related events (acknowledgements, timeouts), `OnChanOpenAck` messages are dispatched by
Neutron to respective contracts via `wasm.Sudo()`. So, in order to process this type of events, you need to implement
the `sudo()` entrypoint for your contract and process the message dispatched by Neutron:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn sudo(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: SudoMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    match msg {
        SudoMsg::OpenAck {
            port_id,
            channel_id,
            counterparty_channel_id,
            counterparty_version,
        } => sudo_open_ack(
            deps,
            env,
            port_id,
            channel_id,
            counterparty_channel_id,
            counterparty_version,
        ),
        _ => Ok(Response::default()),
    }
}

fn sudo_open_ack(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    port_id: String,
    _channel_id: String,
    _counterparty_channel_id: String,
    counterparty_version: String,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    // The version variable contains a JSON value with multiple fields,
    // including the generated account address.
    let parsed_version: Result<OpenAckVersion, _> =
        serde_json_wasm::from_str(counterparty_version.as_str());

    // Update the storage record associated with the interchain account.
    if let Ok(parsed_version) = parsed_version {
        INTERCHAIN_ACCOUNTS.save(
            deps.storage,
            port_id,
            &Some((
                parsed_version.address,
                parsed_version.controller_connection_id,
            )),
        )?;
        return Ok(Response::default());
    }

    Err(StdError::generic_err("Can't parse counterparty_version"))
}
```

1. All possible message types that can come from Neutron are listed in the [SudoMsg](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron-sdk/blob/main/packages/neutron-sdk/src/sudo/msg.rs) enum. Here we implement a handler
   just for one element of this enum, `SudoMsg::OpenAck`;
2. If the interchain account was successfully created, you might want to know what account address was generated for you
   on the host zone. This information is contained in
   the `counterparty_version` variable ([see the structure](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/42240b54f23ae1d2f8f170f942e49e54ebb7588a/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/types/metadata.pb.go#L28))
   , which we need to parse. If we are able to parse it successfully, we save the remote address and the connection
   identifier to the previously created entry in the `INTERCHAIN_ACCOUNTS` storage.

> **Note:** it is required that you implement a `sudo()` handler in your contract if you are using the interchain
> transactions module, even if for some reason you don't want to implement any specific logic for IBC events.

> **Note:** you can organise your `INTERCHAIN_ACCOUNTS` storage in any way that suits your needs. for example, you can
> also save the `interchain_account_id` value there to have easy access to it from inside your contract.

After your contract successfully processed the `SudoMsg::OpenAck` event sent by Neutron, you can start using the
Interchain Account that was created for you.

## 3. Execute an interchain transaction

### Sending the transaction

```rust
use cosmos_sdk_proto::cosmos::staking::v1beta1::{
    MsgDelegate, MsgDelegateResponse
};

// Default timeout for SubmitTX is two weeks
const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: u64 = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

/// SudoPayload is a type that stores information about a transaction that we try to execute
/// on the host chain. This is a type introduced for our convenience.
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct SudoPayload {
    pub message: String,
    pub port_id: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Register {
        connection_id: String,
        interchain_account_id: String,
    },
    Delegate {
        interchain_account_id: String,
        validator: String,
        amount: u128,
        denom: String,
        timeout: Option<u64>,
    }
}


#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    _: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response<NeutronMsg>> {
    deps.api
        .debug(format!("WASMDEBUG: execute: received msg: {:?}", msg).as_str());
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Register {
            connection_id,
            interchain_account_id,
        } => execute_register_ica(deps, env, connection_id, interchain_account_id),
        ExecuteMsg::Delegate {
            validator,
            interchain_account_id,
            amount,
            denom,
            timeout,
        } => execute_delegate(
            deps,
            env,
            interchain_account_id,
            validator,
            amount,
            denom,
            timeout,
        ),
    }
}

fn execute_delegate(
    mut deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    interchain_account_id: String,
    validator: String,
    amount: u128,
    denom: String,
    timeout: Option<u64>,
) -> StdResult<Response<NeutronMsg>> {
    // Get the delegator address from the storage & form the Delegate message.
    let (delegator, connection_id) = get_ica(deps.as_ref(), &env, &interchain_account_id)?;
    let delegate_msg = MsgDelegate {
        delegator_address: delegator,
        validator_address: validator,
        amount: Some(Coin {
            denom,
            amount: amount.to_string(),
        }),
    };

    // Serialize the Delegate message.
    let mut buf = Vec::new();
    buf.reserve(delegate_msg.encoded_len());

    if let Err(e) = delegate_msg.encode(&mut buf) {
        return Err(StdError::generic_err(format!("Encode error: {}", e)));
    }

    // Put the serialized Delegate message to a types.Any protobuf message.
    let any_msg = ProtobufAny {
        type_url: "/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgDelegate".to_string(),
        value: Binary::from(buf),
    };

    // specify fees to refund relayers for submission of ack and timeout messages
    //
    // The contract MUST HAVE recv_fee + ack_fee + timeout_fee coins on its balance!
    // See more info about fees here: https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-txs/messages#msgsubmittx
    // and here: https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/feerefunder/overview
    let fee = IbcFee {
        recv_fee: vec![], // must be empty
        ack_fee: vec![CosmosCoin::new(100000u128, "untrn")],
        timeout_fee: vec![CosmosCoin::new(100000u128, "untrn")],
    };

    // Form the neutron SubmitTx message containing the binary Delegate message.
    let cosmos_msg = NeutronMsg::submit_tx(
        connection_id,
        interchain_account_id.clone(),
        vec![any_msg],
        "".to_string(),
        timeout.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS),
        fee
    );

    // We use a submessage here because we need the process message reply to save
    // the outgoing IBC packet identifier for later.
    let submsg = msg_with_sudo_callback(
        deps.branch(),
        cosmos_msg,
        SudoPayload {
            port_id: get_port_id(env.contract.address.to_string(), &interchain_account_id),
            // Here you can store some information about the transaction to help you parse
            // the acknowledgement later.
            message: "interchain_delegate".to_string(),
        },
    )?;

    Ok(Response::default().add_submessages(vec![submsg]))
}

fn msg_with_sudo_callback<C: Into<CosmosMsg<T>>, T>(
    deps: DepsMut,
    msg: C,
    payload: SudoPayload,
) -> StdResult<SubMsg<T>> {
    save_reply_payload(deps.storage, payload)?;
    Ok(SubMsg::reply_on_success(msg, SUDO_PAYLOAD_REPLY_ID))
}

// Add storage for reply ids
pub const REPLY_ID_STORAGE: Item<Vec<u8>> = Item::new("reply_queue_id");

pub fn save_reply_payload(store: &mut dyn Storage, payload: SudoPayload) -> StdResult<()> {
    REPLY_ID_STORAGE.save(store, &to_vec(&payload)?)
}
```

1. First we need to import the `MsgDelegate` type from the `cosmos_sdk_proto` library. This is required to marshal the
   message and put it to the IBC packet sent by the ICA module;
2. Then we implement a handler for the new `ExecuteMsg::Delegate` handler, `execute_delegate()`, and add it to
   our `execute()` entrypoint;
3. Inside the `execute_delegate()` handler, we get the interchain account address from the storage, form a `Delegate`
   message, form an `IBCFee` structure that specifies fees to refund relayers for submission of `ack` and `timeout` messages, put it and the formed `Delegate` message inside Neutron's `SubmitTx` message and execute it as a submessage. Inside
   the `msg_with_sudo_callback()` function, we set up the reply payload using the `SUDO_PAYLOAD_REPLY_ID` value.

We need to execute the `SubmitTx` message as a submessage because Neutron returns the outgoing IBC packet identifier for
us as a message reply. This IBC packet identifier is necessary to later determine which To process it, we need to
implement the `reply()` handler:

```rust
#[entry_point]
pub fn reply(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    match msg.id {
        SUDO_PAYLOAD_REPLY_ID => prepare_sudo_payload(deps, env, msg),
        _ => Err(StdError::generic_err(format!(
            "unsupported reply message id {}",
            msg.id
        ))),
    }
}

fn prepare_sudo_payload(mut deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, msg: Reply) -> StdResult<Response> {
    let payload = read_reply_payload(deps.storage)?;
    let resp: MsgSubmitTxResponse = serde_json_wasm::from_slice(
        msg.result
            .into_result()
            .map_err(StdError::generic_err)?
            .data
            .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("no result"))?
            .as_slice(),
    )
    .map_err(|e| StdError::generic_err(format!("failed to parse response: {:?}", e)))?;
    deps.api
        .debug(format!("WASMDEBUG: reply msg: {:?}", resp).as_str());
    let seq_id = resp.sequence_id;
    let channel_id = resp.channel;
    save_sudo_payload(deps.branch().storage, channel_id, seq_id, payload)?;
    Ok(Response::new())
}

pub fn read_reply_payload(store: &mut dyn Storage) -> StdResult<SudoPayload> {
    let data = REPLY_ID_STORAGE.load(store)?;
    from_binary(&Binary(data))
}

pub fn save_sudo_payload(
    store: &mut dyn Storage,
    channel_id: String,
    seq_id: u64,
    payload: SudoPayload,
) -> StdResult<()> {
    SUDO_PAYLOAD.save(store, (channel_id, seq_id), &to_vec(&payload)?)
}
```

### IBC Events

After we saved the IBC packet identifier, we are ready for processing the IBC events that can be triggered by an IBC
relayer: an acknowledgement or a timeout. In order to process them, we need to add a couple of new handlers to
the `sudo()` entrypoint:

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn sudo(deps: DepsMut, env: Env, msg: SudoMsg) -> StdResult<Response> {
    match msg {
        // For handling successful (non-error) acknowledgements.
        SudoMsg::Response { request, data } => sudo_response(deps, request, data),

        // For handling error acknowledgements.
        SudoMsg::Error { request, details } => sudo_error(deps, request, details),

        // For handling error timeouts.
        SudoMsg::Timeout { request } => sudo_timeout(deps, env, request),

        SudoMsg::OpenAck {
            port_id,
            channel_id,
            counterparty_channel_id,
            counterparty_version,
        } => sudo_open_ack(
            deps,
            env,
            port_id,
            channel_id,
            counterparty_channel_id,
            counterparty_version,
        ),
        _ => Ok(Response::default()),
    }
}

// Interchain transaction responses - here we just save ack/err/timeout state
pub const ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RESULTS: Map<(String, u64), AcknowledgementResult> =
    Map::new("acknowledgement_results");

/// Serves for storing acknowledgement calls for interchain transactions
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, JsonSchema, Debug)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum AcknowledgementResult {
    /// Success - Got success acknowledgement in sudo with array of message item types in it
    Success(Vec<String>),
    /// Error - Got error acknowledgement in sudo with payload message in it and error details
    Error((String, String)),
    /// Timeout - Got timeout acknowledgement in sudo with payload message in it
    Timeout(String),
}
```

#### Successful Response

Let's have a look at how to handle a successful Response event (a non-error IBC Acknowledgement):

```rust
fn sudo_response(deps: DepsMut, request: RequestPacket, data: Binary) -> StdResult<Response> {
    deps.api.debug(
        format!(
            "WASMDEBUG: sudo_response: sudo received: {:?} {:?}",
            request, data
        )
        .as_str(),
    );

    // Get the channel identifier and the sequence identifier to be able to understand
    // which transaction is acknowledged by this packet, and for which Interchain Account.
    //
    // In this particular case, we return an error because not having the sequence id
    // in the request value implies that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side.
    let seq_id = request
        .sequence
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("sequence not found"))?;

    // In this particular case, we return an error because not having the sequence id
    // in the request value implies that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side.
    let channel_id = request
        .source_channel
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("channel_id not found"))?;

    // Read the information about the transaction that we previously executed and saved to state.
    //
    // In this particular example, this is a matter of developer's choice. Not being able to read
    // the payload here means that there was a problem with the contract while submitting an
    // interchain transaction. You can decide that this is not worth killing the channel,
    // write an error log and / or save the acknowledgement to an errors queue for later manual
    // processing. The decision is based purely on your application logic.
    let payload = read_sudo_payload(deps.storage, channel_id, seq_id).ok();
    if payload.is_none() {
        let error_msg = "WASMDEBUG: Error: Unable to read sudo payload";
        deps.api.debug(error_msg);
        add_error_to_queue(deps.storage, error_msg.to_string());
        return Ok(Response::default());
    }

    deps.api
        .debug(format!("WASMDEBUG: sudo_response: sudo payload: {:?}", payload).as_str());

    // Parse the response to Vec<MsgData>.
    //
    // In this particular case, we return an error because not being able to parse this data
    // that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side, or that the remote chain sent us unexpected data.
    // Both cases require immediate attention.
    let parsed_data = decode_acknowledgement_response(data)?;

    // Iterate over the messages, parse them depending on their type & process them.
    let mut item_types = vec![];
    for item in parsed_data {
        let item_type = item.msg_type.as_str();
        item_types.push(item_type.to_string());
        match item_type {
            "/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgDelegate" => {
                // In this particular case, a mismatch between the string message type and the
                // serialised data layout looks like a fatal error that has to be investigated.
                let _out: MsgDelegateResponse = decode_message_response(&item.data)?;
            }
            _ => {
                deps.api.debug(
                    format!(
                        "This type of acknowledgement is not implemented: {:?}",
                        payload
                    )
                    .as_str(),
                );
            }
        }
    }

    if let Some(payload) = payload {
        // update but also check that we don't update same seq_id twice
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RESULTS.update(
            deps.storage,
            (payload.port_id, seq_id),
            |maybe_ack| -> StdResult<AcknowledgementResult> {
                match maybe_ack {
                    Some(_ack) => Err(StdError::generic_err("trying to update same seq_id")),
                    None => Ok(AcknowledgementResult::Success(item_types)),
                }
            },
        )?;
    }

    Ok(Response::default())
}

pub fn read_sudo_payload(
    store: &mut dyn Storage,
    channel_id: String,
    seq_id: u64,
) -> StdResult<SudoPayload> {
    let data = SUDO_PAYLOAD.load(store, (channel_id, seq_id))?;

1. We get the sequence and channel identifiers to retrieve the information about the interchain transaction from our
   local storage. _Note_: we could instead parse the raw data from the `RequestPacket`, but it feels more natural to
   save
   the required information when sending the transaction and to retrieve it from the state when processing the response;
2. We parse the response data and start iterating over the message responses, determining the message type for each of
   them and (potentially) executing custom logic for each message.

> **Note**: if your Sudo handler fails, the acknowledgment won't be marked as processed inside the IBC module. This will
> make most IBC relayers try to submit the acknowledgment over and over again. And since the ICA channels are `ORDERED`,
> ACKs must be processed in the same order as corresponding transactions were sent, meaning no further acknowledgments
> will be process until the previous one processed successfully.
>
> We strongly recommend developers to write Sudo handlers very carefully and keep them as simple as possible. If you do
> want to have elaborate logic in your handler, you should verify the acknowledgement data before making any state
> changes; that way you can, if the data received with the acknowledgement is incompatible with executing the handler
> logic normally, return an `Ok()` response immediately, which will prevent the acknowledgement from being resubmitted.

#### Error

```rust
fn sudo_error(deps: DepsMut, request: RequestPacket, details: String) -> StdResult<Response> {
    deps.api
        .debug(format!("WASMDEBUG: sudo error: {}", details).as_str());
    deps.api
        .debug(format!("WASMDEBUG: request packet: {:?}", request).as_str());

    // In this particular case, we return an error because not having the sequence id
    // in the request value implies that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side.
    let seq_id = request
        .sequence
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("sequence not found"))?;

    // In this particular case, we return an error because not having the sequence id
    // in the request value implies that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side.
    let channel_id = request
        .source_channel
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("channel_id not found"))?;
    let payload = read_sudo_payload(deps.storage, channel_id, seq_id).ok();

    if let Some(payload) = payload {
        // update but also check that we don't update same seq_id twice
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RESULTS.update(
            deps.storage,
            (payload.port_id, seq_id),
            |maybe_ack| -> StdResult<AcknowledgementResult> {
                match maybe_ack {
                    Some(_ack) => Err(StdError::generic_err("trying to update same seq_id")),
                    None => Ok(AcknowledgementResult::Error((payload.message, details))),
                }
            },
        )?;
    } else {
        let error_msg = "WASMDEBUG: Error: Unable to read sudo payload";
        deps.api.debug(error_msg);
        add_error_to_queue(deps.storage, error_msg.to_string());
    }

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

This handler is very similar to `sudo_response()`. Unfortunately, current ICA implementation does not allow you to get
the exact error string that was returned by the host chain; your controller code can only know that something went
wrong on the other side.

#### Timeout

```rust
fn sudo_timeout(deps: DepsMut, _env: Env, request: RequestPacket) -> StdResult<Response> {
    deps.api
        .debug(format!("WASMDEBUG: sudo timeout request: {:?}", request).as_str());

    // In this particular case, we return an error because not having the sequence id
    // in the request value implies that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side.
    let seq_id = request
        .sequence
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("sequence not found"))?;

    // In this particular case, we return an error because not having the sequence id
    // in the request value implies that a fatal error occurred on Neutron side.
    let channel_id = request
        .source_channel
        .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("channel_id not found"))?;

    // update but also check that we don't update same seq_id twice

    // In this particular example, this is a matter of developer's choice. Not being able to read
    // the payload here means that there was a problem with the contract while submitting an
    // interchain transaction. You can decide that this is not worth killing the channel,
    // write an error log and / or save the acknowledgement to an errors queue for later manual
    // processing. The decision is based purely on your application logic.
    // Please be careful because it may lead to an unexpected state changes because state might
    // has been changed before this call and will not be reverted because of suppressed error.
    let payload = read_sudo_payload(deps.storage, channel_id, seq_id).ok();
    if let Some(payload) = payload {
        // update but also check that we don't update same seq_id twice
        ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_RESULTS.update(
            deps.storage,
            (payload.port_id, seq_id),
            |maybe_ack| -> StdResult<AcknowledgementResult> {
                match maybe_ack {
                    Some(_ack) => Err(StdError::generic_err("trying to update same seq_id")),
                    None => Ok(AcknowledgementResult::Timeout(payload.message)),
                }
            },
        )?;
    } else {
        let error_msg = "WASMDEBUG: Error: Unable to read sudo payload";
        deps.api.debug(error_msg);
        add_error_to_queue(deps.storage, error_msg.to_string());
    }

    Ok(Response::default())
}
```

This handler looks exactly the same as the previous one. The `Timeout` event, however, should be treated with extra
attention. There is no dedicated event for a closed channel (ICA disables all messages related to closing the channels).
Your channel, however, can still be closed if a packet timeout occurs. This means that if you are notified about a
packet
timeout, **you can be sure that the affected channel was closed**.

> **Note:** it is generally a good practice to set the packet timeout for your interchain transactions to a really large
> value.

If the timeout occurs anyway, you can just
execute [RegisterInterchainAccount message]( /neutron/modules/interchain-txs/messages#msgregisterinterchainaccount) again to
recover access to your interchain account.
