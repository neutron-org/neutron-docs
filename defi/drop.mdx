## Liquid Staking Powered by Neutron

<div className="p-4 border-l-4 border-primary bg-primary/5 rounded my-6">
  Drop Protocol is a multi-chain liquid staking solution built on Neutron that leverages the chain's interchain capabilities to provide secure liquid staking across the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond.
</div>

For comprehensive documentation on Drop Protocol, please visit the [official Drop documentation](https://docs.drop.money/).

## Neutron Integration

Drop Protocol showcases the power of Neutron's integrated architecture by utilizing several core modules:

**Interchain Transactions (ICTX)**: Enables Drop to control staking operations across multiple chains without requiring separate validators or infrastructure for each chain.

**Interchain Queries (ICQ)**: Allows Drop to fetch and verify staking data from source chains in a trust-minimized way, ensuring accurate reward calculations and security.

**Duality Orderbook**: Provides deep liquidity pools for dAssets (Drop's liquid staking tokens), enabling efficient trading with minimal slippage.

**Supervaults Integration**: Allows dAssets to be deployed in Supervaults for additional yield on top of staking rewards, enhancing capital efficiency.

## Capital Efficiency Through Integration
