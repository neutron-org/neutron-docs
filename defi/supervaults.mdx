Supervaults (mmvault contracts) are Neutron's flagship DeFi innovation that manage liquidity on behalf of users by efficiently allocating deposits into the Neutron DEX (Duality). Using Neutron's integrated infrastructure, they automatically rebalance positions across different price ranges and fee tiers, achieving maximal capital efficiency and improving outcomes for both traders and liquidity providers.

The vault contract abstracts away direct DEX interactions from end users, allowing users to interact through standardized deposit and withdrawal flows while the vault autonomously manages liquidity provisioning via Cron-triggered rebalancing logic.

Unlike traditional yield vaults or static liquidity pools, Supervaults actively optimize capital deployment to:

- Minimize slippage for traders through concentrated liquidity
- Maximize fees earned by liquidity providers across multiple fee tiers
- Reduce impermanent loss through dynamic position management and rebalancing

  <Card title="For Traders" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    Supervaults provide deeper liquidity at current price points, resulting in significantly reduced slippage for large trades and better execution quality.

## How Supervaults Work

Supervaults integrate with Neutron's core modules to enable continuous, trustless operation:

### User Flows

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deposit Process" icon="wallet" iconType="duotone">
    Users deposit paired tokens (token0 and token1) and receive LP shares minted via Neutron's token factory module, representing their proportional claim on the vault's total value.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Withdrawal Process" icon="money-bill-transfer" iconType="duotone">
    Users redeem LP shares to withdraw their proportional share of vault assets. The vault handles complex DEX position management automatically during withdrawals.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Automated Rebalancing with Cron and Slinky Oracle

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Slinky Oracle Integration" icon="globe" iconType="duotone">
    Supervaults leverage Neutron's Slinky price oracle to fetch fresh price data for precise rebalancing calculations and liquidity positioning.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Two-Phase Rebalancing" icon="clock" iconType="duotone">
    The Cron module triggers a two-phase rebalancing process each block: first withdrawing all active positions, then redeploying liquidity based on current market conditions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Multi-Tier Deployment" icon="layer-group" iconType="duotone">
    Liquidity is strategically deployed across different price ranges and fee tiers, optimizing for both capital efficiency and fee generation.
  </Card>

### Technical Architecture

    A[User Deposits Token0 & Token1] --> B[Supervault Contract]
    B --> C[Mint LP Shares via Token Factory]
    C --> D[User Receives LP Shares]
    
    E[Cron Module] --> F[dex_withdrawal Function]
    F --> G[Withdraw All Active DEX Positions]
    G --> H[dex_deposit Function]
    
    I[Slinky Oracle] --> H
    H --> J[Calculate Target Tick & Fee Tiers]
    J --> K[Deploy Liquidity via MsgDeposit]
    K --> L[Duality DEX Positions]
    
    L --> M[Generate Trading Fees]
    M --> B
    
    N[User Withdraws] --> O[Burn LP Shares]
    O --> B
    B --> P[Return Proportional Assets]
```

The complete rebalancing flow works as follows:

1. **dex_withdrawal()**: Each block, Cron first triggers withdrawal of all active DEX positions owned by the vault
2. **dex_deposit()**: Immediately after, it fetches fresh prices from Slinky oracle and recomputes optimal liquidity deployment
3. **Strategic Positioning**: Based on fee tier allocation, token imbalance, and configured parameters, liquidity is deployed across multiple price ranges
4. **Full Custody**: The vault maintains complete custody of all funds throughout the process

## Capital Efficiency Advantages

Supervaults achieve exceptional capital efficiency through several mechanisms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Concentrated Liquidity Management" icon="layer-group" iconType="duotone">
    Unlike passive AMMs, Supervaults actively concentrate liquidity around current market prices across multiple fee tiers, maximizing capital utilization.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automated Fee Tier Optimization" icon="chart-pie" iconType="duotone">
    The vault automatically allocates liquidity across different fee tiers based on market conditions, optimizing for both volume and fee generation.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dynamic Rebalancing" icon="arrow-trend-up" iconType="duotone">
    Continuous rebalancing ensures liquidity stays optimally positioned as market conditions change, without requiring manual intervention.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Proportional Share System" icon="database" iconType="duotone">
    The token factory-based LP share system ensures fair distribution of rewards and accurate tracking of user ownership through all rebalancing operations.
