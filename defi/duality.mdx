Duality is a protocol-native orderbook integrated directly into Neutron's core infrastructure that merges the strengths of orderbooks and AMMs into a unified, capital-efficient design. Unlike traditional orderbooks implemented as smart contracts, Duality is built at the protocol level, giving it significant performance advantages and deeper integration with other Neutron features.

## Technical Architecture

Duality is built directly into Neutron's core infrastructure as a native protocol module, making it highly capital-efficient and integrated with other Neutron applications. It **maintains a full limit orderbook** for precise price discovery and execution while supporting diverse order types. **Open composability** ensures the fully open-source design allows other applications to build on top, enhancing overall ecosystem liquidity.
