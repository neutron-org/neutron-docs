  <strong>The Neutron DeFi advantage:</strong>
  <ul className="mt-2">
    <li><strong>Integrated infrastructure:</strong> Core modules like Oracle, Cron, and orderbook work together seamlessly</li>
    <li><strong>Capital efficiency:</strong> Assets can be utilized in multiple ways simultaneously</li>
    <li><strong>Professional market-making:</strong> Just-In-Time (JIT) orders on Duality enable high-frequency market-making with minimal adverse selection</li>
    <li><strong>Trustless interchain operations:</strong> ICQ and ICTX modules enable true cross-chain DeFi without bridges</li>
  </ul>

## Clusters: Narrative-based Trading

<Card title="Introducing Clusters">
  <p>
    Cryptocurrencies are often driven by narratives. Clusters make it easy to long and short narratives by combining multiple long and short positions into one.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-2">
    Bullish on BTC dominance? Create a cluster that longs BTC and shorts assets you're bearish on. Bearish on Ethereum L2s? Create a cluster that shorts ARB, OP, and ZK.
  </p>
  <p className="mt-2">
    Explore pre-made clusters or create your own to get targeted exposure to specific market narratives.
