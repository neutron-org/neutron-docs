    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quick Setup (Alternative)">
    If you prefer to set up dependencies first, install Rust and the WebAssembly target:
    
    ```bash
    # Install Rust
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup default stable
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Your First Contract (Alternative)">
    ```bash
    # Generate a CosmWasm project
    cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name my-contract
    cd my-contract
    cargo wasm
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## For Operators

<Steps>
  <Step title="System Requirements">
    Ensure your system meets these requirements:
    
    - **CPU**: 16+ cores, ≥3.5 GHz base clock
    - **RAM**: 64GB minimum, 128GB recommended
    - **Storage**: 500GB+ NVMe SSD
    - **Network**: 100+ Mbps, stable connection

    <Note>
      Bare metal servers are recommended over cloud VMs for optimal performance.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Node">
    Follow our [Running a Node](/operators/running-a-node) guide to set up your Neutron full node.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Role">
    Operators can run various infrastructure components:
    - **Validators**: [Become a Validator](/operators/becoming-a-validator) to join the active set
    - **Oracles**: [Set up Oracle](/operators/oracle-setup) to provide price feeds
    - **For Relayers**: [Run IBC Relayer](/operators/ibc-relayer) to facilitate cross-chain communication and [Run ICQ Relayer](/operators/icq-relayer) to enable interchain queries
