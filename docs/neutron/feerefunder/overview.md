# Overview

## Abstract

This document specifies the FeeRefunder module for the Neutron network.

The FeeRefunder module implements a mechanism and contains methods to make refunds to IBC relayers for their submission of IBC `Ack` and `Timeout` packets.

## Concepts

Due to the fact that contracts are allowed to make calls to the IBC as well as process all received data, a problem arieses in which a malicious contract can make a call to the IBC and, during the response of the `Ack` or `Timeout`, make another IBC call and so on forever. Which will lead to drainage of relayer's funds and spamming of the network.

In order to avoid such problem, the code in the module forces the contract to pay for all Acknoledgements and Timeout messages it processes.

The mechanism behind the module is inspired by [ICS-29](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-029-fee-payment). ICS-29 itself requires both chains (target and source chains) to support the specifications which is not quite good for Neutron, since we want to connect as many chains as possible, and that's hard with ICS-29, since not so many chains use the latest [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) version.

That is why we decided to implement our own IBC Fees module, which allows to refund relayers for their `Ack/Timeout` submission, but with the same interface for the smart-contract developers. So when Neutron will support native ICS-29, there will no need for smart-contract developers to change their contracts, upgrading to the "official" fees module will be very smooth.

### General mechanics
The module requires smart-contracts, which use [Transfer](../transfer/messages#msgtransfer) and [SubmitTx](../interchain-txs/messages#msgsubmittx) messages from respective [Transfer](../transfer/overview) and [Interchain Transactions](../interchain-txs/overview) modules, to provide fee values to refund relayers for particular type of IBC packet acknoledgements when sending such messages:
* `ack_fee` - amount of coins to refund relayer for submittting ack message for a particular IBC packet (i.e. `500untrn`);
* `timeout_fee` - amount of coins to refund relayer for submitting timeout message for a particular IBC packet (i.e. `500untrn`);
* `recv_fee` - currently is used for compatibility with ICS-29 interface only and **must be set to zero** (i.e. `0untrn`), because Neutron's fee module can't refund relayers for submission of `Recv` IBC packets due to compatibility with target chains.
* `payer` - optional address which will pay for the fees. Please note that payer must [give allowance](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/feegrant/01_concepts.html#grant) [#1](#feedetails) to the contract to spend fees.

> **Note:** the fees can be specified only in native Cosmos-SDK coins. CW-20 coins are not supported!

When a smart-contract issues `Transfer` or `SubmitTx` message, the Fee Refunder Module deducts the whole specified fee amount (`ack_fee + timeout_fee + recv_fee`) from contract address or from payer address (if it is defined and there is allowance from payer to contract address) and locks that amount in the module's escrow address. When a relayer submits `Ack` message for a particular packet, the module sends the specified amount of `ack_fee` to the relayer from the escrow address and return the specified `timeout_fee` to the contract (or fee payer) which issued the original `Transfer` or `SubmitTx` message. In case when relayer submits `Timeout` message, things go the other way around: the relayer is refunded with `timeout_fee` and the contract (or fee payer) gets `ack_fee` back.

* A fee payer is an address that holds tokens that can be used to pay for the interchain transaction fees.

* The fee payer can grant an allowance to a contract address, which allows the contract to use tokens from this address for the fees. Optionally, a limit, expiration date and period can be set. Please refer to the [feegrant module's documentation in the Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/feegrant/) for more information.

* When an interchain transaction or transfer message is requested by a contract, the feerefunder module checks the allowance in general by using the feegrant module's GetAllowance function.

* The feerefunder module then calls the Accept method on the returned interface with the total fees as an argument to check if the contract has permission to use the required amount of tokens and to deduct them from the allowance.

* If the allowance is enough for spending fee, the feerefunder module transfers fee from fee payer address to the module's escrow address and saves the fee payer address in state by PacketID.

* Then interchain transaction or transfer message is sent to the IBC module.

* When the IBC module receives the Ack or Timeout message, the module sends the specified amount of fee to the relayer from the escrow address and return the rest of fees to the fee payer's address.

> **Note:** the minimal amount of fee to be specified for the messages above is defined via parameter [`min_fee`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/blob/9cdd583bd754d0e4d5f2e16d7414cf80151b205d/proto/feerefunder/params.proto#L13) controlled by governance proposal.
If provided fees are less than `min_fee` parameter, `Transfer` or `SubmitTx` or message will be rejected.
