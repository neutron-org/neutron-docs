# Overview

## Abstract

This document specifies the Cron module for the Neutron network.

The Cron module implements a mechanism to add cron schedules through governance proposals to execute arbitrary CosmWasm messages with a given period.

## Concepts

### High level Mechanism
- add schedule using governance proposals [Permissioned - Main DAO];
- remove schedule using governance proposals [Permissioned - Main DAO or Security subDAO];
- every given block period execute cosmwasm msgs for added schedules.

### General Mechanics

The module allows to receive `AddSchedule` and `RemoveSchedule` custom neutron messages from cosmwasm contracts.

It also contains permissions:
- AddSchedule can only be executed as main dao governance proposal
- RemoveSchedule can only be executed as main dao governance proposal OR security subdao proposal

In EndBlocker module searches for all schedules (with limit by `Params.Limit`) that are ready to be executed, using `last_execute_height`.

That way after the schedule was added it will be executed every `period` of blocks (or more than `period` if too many schedules ready to execute).

The formats are as follows:
```go
// AddSchedule adds new schedule to the cron module
type AddSchedule struct {
  // Name of the schedule
	Name   string               `json:"name"`
  // Period of the schedule in blocks
	Period uint64               `json:"period"`
  // Msgs that will be executed every period
	Msgs   []MsgExecuteContract `json:"msgs"`
}

// MsgExecuteContract defined separate from wasmtypes since we can get away with just passing the string into bindings
type MsgExecuteContract struct {
	// Contract is the address of the smart contract
	Contract string `json:"contract,omitempty"`
	// Msg json encoded message to be passed to the contract
	Msg string `json:"msg,omitempty"`
}
```

After collecting all schedules ready for execution, we execute them in order.

For each schedule, every stored msg is complemented with more necessary fields to form wasmtypes.MsgExecuteContract:
```go
// wasmtypes.MsgExecuteContract
msg := type MsgExecuteContract struct {
	Sender string // Cron module account
	Contract string // Passed with AddSchedule.Msgs
	Msg // Passed with AddSchedule.Msgs
	Funds sdk.Coins // Empty Coins
}
```

Then it's executed using wasmd WasmMsgServer implementation.

For state to be modified, all messages in a given schedule should return successful result.
If any cosmwasm msg fails to execute for any reason, all messages in a given schedule will be rolled back.

## Example

### Adding schedule
To add schedule we need to send governance proposal using dao contracts.

Construct a message in a following format:

```json
{
  "propose": {
    "msg": {
      "propose": {
        "title": "Proposal title",
        "description": "Proposal description",
        "msgs": [
          {
            "custom": {
              "add_schedule": {
                "name": "simple", // schedule name
                "period": 5, // period in blocks
                [
                  {
                    "contract": "neutron123412341234", // contract address to be called
                    "msg": "{\"send\": {\"to\": "neutron123", \"amount\": 100}}", // message to be executed
                  },
                ],
              },
            }
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```      

Submit the proposal to the Main DAO using prePropose contract address.

If it will be accepted, schedule will be added with the given params.

### Removing schedule

To remove schedule we need to send governance proposal using dao contracts.

Construct a message in a following format:

```json
{
  "propose": {
    "msg": {
      "propose": {
        "title": "Proposal title",
        "description": "Proposal description",
        "msgs": [
          {
            "custom": {
              "remove_schedule": {
                "name": "simple", // schedule name
              },
            }
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Submit the proposal to the Main DAO using prePropose contract address.

If it will be accepted, schedule will be added with the given params.
