## The Problem: Finance is Broken

Traditional finance has always been about keeping the best opportunities for insiders. Billions remain unbanked, while the wealthy enjoy better rates, services, and opportunities, exacerbating inequality.

Meanwhile, the blockchain industry is chaotic—chasing hype cycles and developing nonsensical use cases to attract VC funding rather than solving real problems.

DeFi promised a fairer alternative but has failed to deliver:

- **Generalist platforms** lack the performance and purpose-specific infrastructure needed for efficient financial applications.
- **Appchains** abandon composability, have weaker network effects, higher costs, and greater maintenance burdens.

The result is fragmentation, inefficiency, and a poor user experience that fails to compete with traditional finance.

## The Solution: An Integrated Blockchain for Finance

There is significant work left to do if we want DeFi to provide a compelling alternative to traditional finance. This is only possible with an opinionated blockchain—not trying to be all things to all people, but laser-focused on DeFi.

Neutron is the first and only blockchain to combine:
- The performance and purpose-specific infrastructure of appchains
- The composability, permissionlessness, and network effects of smart contracting platforms

This unique approach unlocks superior DeFi applications that are impossible to build elsewhere, offering better capital efficiency and execution to users—which is what matters in finance as the history of markets has shown.

As Neutron offers increasingly better prices, savings, and investment opportunities, it will capture more and more demand for financial services.

## What This Means in Practice

Unlike other networks where applications are isolated in the VM, apps on Neutron can tap directly into the network's bespoke resources. Developers can leverage purpose-built infrastructure that enables superior designs impossible to build elsewhere.

Applications on Neutron benefit from:
- Per-block price oracles without third-party dependencies
- Integrated automation for consistent execution of critical functions
- Trust-minimized cross-chain account control and state queries
- Native market primitives for efficient capital allocation
